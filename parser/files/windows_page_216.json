We would suggest you to importing the photos in batches of 250-300 photos at a time and see if it works for you.\u00a0Couple of our users were also able to fix the issue by changing the file permissions for the Pictures folder. We can also try changing file permissions and see if that makes a difference. Please refer to the steps mentioned below:\u00a0Right click on the Pictures folder and selectProperties.

It's the same problem and I'll explain it. Basically, I think there's something to do with Windows not recognizing or working well with the GPU(s). I currently am running an external GPU (GTX 670) via ExpressCard EXP GDC to my laptop and am using an external display with it. The iGPU (Intel HD 3000) is connected to my internal laptop display and I left it enabled but disabled the dGPU (NVIDIA NVS 4200M) in case I ran into any problems (NVIDIA Optimus, etc.). And that all worked out fine but when I finished upgrading from Windows 10 1809 to 1903, my monitor\/external display wasn't working (the eGPU was still on and connected) and only the internal display worked. So I went digging around and found out that in Device Manager, Windows disabled my eGPU because it was reporting problems and therefore that was why it recognized the eGPU but couldn't send a video signal to it to my monitor. However, the dGPU (the one I purposely disabled before) got re-enabled somehow and before I could do any more poking around I got a BSOD saying that there was a \"video scheduler internal error\".\u00a0 So I restarted my computer and was left with the same results until Windows prompted me to the advanced restore settings after I booted it up and I restored my computer back to version 1809 (uninstalled the 1903 update) and everything worked fine. So I was wondering if there was a way to fix this so that I can update my computer successfully?\u00a0Computer Specifications:2nd Generation Sandy Bridge Intel Core i7-2640M Processor (Dual-Core) 3.50 GHziGPU- Intel HD 3000dGPU- NVIDIA NVS 4200MeGPU- NVIDIA GTX 6708GB 1333MHz DDR3 RAM500GB Boot SSD, 250GB Secondary SSDDell Latitude E6520Windows 10 Version 1809","solutions":["Hi Ethan. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Guardian Moderator here to help you.Disabling a driver in Device manager is not enough because a Version Upgrade reinstalls Windows so wipes all that out. You must disable it in BIOS\/UEFI Setup, or else physically unplug it.I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1903 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m..., choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems. If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are unfixable for now, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings. You can then hide it so it doesn't try to reinstall following this same method:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta... Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you will wait to rate my post, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.
