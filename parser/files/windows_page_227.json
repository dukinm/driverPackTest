I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Of course an in-place Upgrade should not touch your data partition, but we see enough horror stories here that I can't promise you there's no chance. Plus please be aware that not having your files backed up at all times is extremely risky, because a hard drive can die at any time without notice. So I'll give you some backup ideas to consider, and suggest that since you need to back up anyway that instead of doing the inferior Upgrade you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... A Clean Install is defined by wiping all partitions off the drive to get it cleanest, during a booted install from Windows installation media provided. You could save the D partition while doing this, but it is not quite as clean - although better than the Upgrade. BACKUP STRATEGIES: 1) You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder using OneDrive Backup, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/116029-turn... 2) Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15gb for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en-GB_ALL\/drive\/dow... 3) In addition I'd have an on-site hard copy backup. The best way to do this is to sort all of your files into their User folders and then drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive. Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files: https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/2086566\/the-man... 4) Besides your files you should save a System Image back up to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:http:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/howto\/7363\/macrium-ref... You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.I hope this helps.

Hello all,I just built a PC a few days ago to give to my dad for Christmas. When setting it up, I applied the RAM's XMP Profile, letting it get up to its full 3200 clock speed. However, this seems to cause the computer to BSOD on occasion and give the error in the title. Even running the RAM at a slightly lower clock speed of 3000 seems to cause trouble.Everything I've looked up for this issue says to update all drivers. I've done this. The motherboard BIOS is the latest version, the CPU drivers are completely up to date, and Windows Update is reporting no new downloads.For reference, the PC contains:CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 3200GRAM: T-Force Vulcan Z 16GBDDR4 3200MoBo: ASRock B450M-HDV R4.0During a chat with Windows Support, it was suggested that it was temperature related. I verified that it wasn't by running a stress test on the CPU and saw only about 63\u00b0C at full load. Alternatively, it was suggested that something was just wrong with my Windows install.Is this caused by the XMP Profile? Seems a waste to have bought 3200 ram only for it to run at 2400.There is another post in the community asking a similar question when updating AMD Drivers, which leads me to believe that the ones I downloaded may be a potential cause. However, I can't \"update\" to a previous version of the driver. A mod mentioned that they would need all the dump files to diagnose the issue. Here is a link to a shared OneDrive folder containing a system information file and all the dump files present in the minidump folder.Thank you!","solutions":["AMD is a bit different than Intel...Either way,if youre Win 10 OS is upgraded, v1903 or better & installed thru Microsoft-Windows Media Creation Tool,or Windows Upgrade Assistant,once the upgrade is thru,one must reinstall all the pc hardware components..Youre pc mfg has all,or run pc hardware components thru AMD,the 1st,as Intel says & AMD should,the Chipset software\/driver,then Storage controller\/Video & Audio are next..Once thru,R.click my computer\/properties\/advanced\/Virtual Memory tab\/Advanced\/Change Button..With C: HD highlited,set to: Let System Manage,click set 2X\u00a0 close out restart pc.63 C\u00a0 is about 150 F if my conversions are correct,that is a lot of temp to the CPU..Best bet,download the pc BIOS update from pc mfg,once run,power off pc.On pc start up,enter BIOS,locate set to advanced settings,usually exit tab,then go back and reset date\/time,edit for add-ons,save and exit..Youre Mini-Dump is always pc memory related,if ram is ok,then follow above in virtual memory\/page file...Once Virtual memory is reset,the cpu temp should go down,dont forget to run disk clean,and defrag...","Hi squeekybeef, I am Rob, an independent and a 14 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis.

If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.The link you posted is empty - please repost (do not just edit a new on in as I will not get notice of an edit).1. Heat related does not always mean the temps are excessive as a single component such as a resistor, capacitor, or so on, could be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat. Use a fan blowing into the case to see if that alters is behavior. Also, you might want to try the stress tests below. 2. Be sure to reseat all the memory (remove all power then remove and replace). 3. Test the memory thoroughly - over 4+ hours. (Even sticks that seem to be an exact match can have tiny speed differences which cause the issues you are having - if all are with-in specs the slower still needs to be in front of faster - so swap the sticks in and out in different combinations and patterns). Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show a problem.
