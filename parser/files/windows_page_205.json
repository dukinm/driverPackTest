Now Windows runs on many different types of hardware. Microsoft is not going to make custom versions of Windows for computers, tablets, Android devices, iOS devices, watches, game consoles, etc. And neither will application software developers. Today, the same software has to run equally well on many devices, so simplicity and consistency are paramount.Moreover, Windows is becoming an increasingly smaller part of Microsoft's business, and will continue in that direction as Windows 10 matures. Microsoft is becoming 'cloud first, mobile first' (as Microsoft's CEO puts it) because that's where the future is. There's simply no money in bringing back the old days.If you long for how Windows used to be, or you need to have it look a certain way, you can probably find an application from a third-party software developer.","If you long for how Windows used to be, or you need to have it look a certain way, you can probably find an application from a third-party software developer.I don't long for the old days, but I like to see more clearly a difference between the active and non-active window, or selected item in the non-active window.
