Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.

The bootable media has it's own drivers, repair and installation files which often work when Windows or the other Repair Mode doesn't.To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m....

If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS\/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore and Uninstall Updates to see if those correct the problems with sign in. If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset. If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki....
