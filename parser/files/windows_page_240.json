Then it changes status to \"No internet, secured\" and I can't reach my router's admin panel (192.168.0.1) or my Raspberry Pi webserver via LAN IPs.

I've had the laptop for two days and I realise that about 20 seconds after I close the lid or hit the power button in order to put the device on sleep mode, it will automatically restart and all tasks that was running will be closed.

While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager>Display adapter>Driver>Update Driver>Browse>Let me pick.In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:http:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/fix-windows-10-sle...

I have to turn it on manually.\u00a0 Is there a way to automatically start streaming when it loads?Thanks\u00a0Chris\u00a0","solutions":["Hi Chris, Just like every other Windows component, there are several related services that govern how Media Sharing functions. After you\u2019ve enabled Media Streaming, the status of these services will change to Active by default. However, in some cases, some of them may be permanently disabled. This prevents Media Streaming from working. To ensure that related services are up and running, observe the steps below: 1. To open Services, go to the Windows Search bar and type services.msc. 2. Locate the UPnP host service in the list and right-click on it. Click on Properties from the menu.3. Set the Startup type to Automatic. 4. Click on Stop > Start to restart the service. 5. Click OK. Navigate to the Windows Media Player Network Sharing service. Right-click on it, select properties and then repeat steps 3 to 5.Close Services and see if you can now use Media Streaming.
