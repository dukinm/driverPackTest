With some difficulty (see below), I can set up and use the shared printer on the client, but if I log out from the client, and then log back in using the same account, the printer share no longer works.I have sharing enabled on the printer host, with the most permissive settings: for both private and guest\/public networks, I have turned on file and printer sharing, and also network discovery. In addition, I have turned on the automatic setup of network connected devices where it is available (i.e. private networks). In the All Networks section, I have turned off password protected sharing, and, for good measure, selected 'turn on sharing so anyone with network access can read and write files in the public folders' and dropped the encryption standard to the lowest (40- and 56-bit) option.

Because hosts is located on system folder replace will ask administrators rights to perform it.","Thanks Craig,Even when this in manual it was running on my PC when I check it.There is some delay, what I was wondering, when I connect to shared resources first time after reboot. Maybe this delay is caused by starting that service when it is needed first time.\u00a0That service is linked to SSDP and UPnP which are also required (with Wi-Fi devices?) so it would be better to set this to start automatic as you wrote.","Pauli, I don't mean to shout, but I'M SO HAPPY!!!\u00a0 THANK YOU!!! I almost have a fully functional LAN again with everything seeing & having access to all again.\u00a0 For troubleshooting purposes, I pulled all but 2 PCs, 1 Surface Pro 3, and a NAS from the LAN after the initial 1803 debacle after following\u00a0Andre's second response here didn't fix things, so now I just have to power the rest up & edit the hosts table on those & fix the sharing as you describe.Pauli, your steps through 5a worked really well for me -- that's what made all the computers show up in File Explorer, Network, Computer.\u00a0 For reasons that are far beyond my understanding, I think the removal of HomeGroups completely tanked the files & folder shares from all our Surface Pros.\u00a0 If I had to guess, my guess would be that the PCs & laptops had originally been networked through Workgroup & those shares were preserved in the bowels of Windows somehow.Your steps on unsharing & resharing worked for me -- I'd been trying the Share, Remove Access in File Explorer, which wasn't particularly successful & created a sharing mess from the SP3.\u00a0 When the PCs would access it (sometimes they could do so successfully but mostly not), they only thing they could \"see\" was \\\\SP3\\Users\\XXX\\OneDrive (which we don't use) & nothing else.\u00a0 Arrgh!\u00a0 Your steps helped me get that sorted.The final success was editing the host - table!\u00a0 Access to the SP3 is golden now -- I've tested & restarted & tested & restarted until I'm blue in the face, and it is all good!\u00a0 Thank you so much!Also, I'm going to try setting the Functional Discovery Services to automatic rather than automatic (delayed) as you suggest because on the SP3, I'm seeing the delay you mentioned -- on the SP3, the SP3 is thelast thing to appear in File Explorer, Network, Computer while everything else appears promptly.One final note:\u00a0 on the SP3, I had to enable SMB 1 following 1803.\u00a0 Prior to 1803, the NSA showed up correctly in File Explorer, Network as a Computer; following 1803 (and the corrections), it showed up only as a Media Device so many of the files were inaccessible.\u00a0 I'm not sure why 1803 broke that (I recall having to do this on the PCs with the Fall Creator Update), but it was working fine on the SP3 without SMB 1 being enabled until 1803.Thanks again, Pauli -- I'm breathing much more easily now!","Hi Pauli O,Thanks much for your very detailed response to my issue.\u00a0 Why Microsoft made the bonehead decision to dump the HomeGroup facility is beyond me.\u00a0 It was an elegant and SIMPLE solution that we mere mortals could implement without having an IT technical degree to simply share photos or whatever among home network computers.\u00a0 Ridiculous in the extreme.\u00a0 I solved my issue temporarily by rolling back the 1803 version to a prior version and everything's the way I want it now.\u00a0 I know it's only temporary but, for now, I'm satisfied.\u00a0 Not everyone wants to dump their private stuff up to some hackable cloud storage facility in order to share stuff.\u00a0 That's the weak answer MS gives to why they made this stupid decision. \u00a0","Thanks. That worked.I had tried all of the steps before, but I didn't think or know about changing those Services settings to\u00a0Automatic (Delayed Start). Now all three of my machines are talking again.I blame Microsoft for losing three to four hours over this. Good thing Users can't bill MS for time wasted over \"Updates\" - MS would be long bankrupt and gone.Now if they would please fix the no choice change to mouse wheel actions imposed by Edge (lose focus and scrolling up and down becomes back and forth between previous pages - I can't imagine how much time I've wasted grappling with that.Good luck with the next free Update, kids. I'm canceling that move to Surface Studio and looking for a Mac.","Thank you for this step-by-step. I have two Win 10 machines, both with the latest update. I have completed each of the steps you outlined, up to and including 6.1a.Computer A can see all of the shared folders on Computer B, but can only access the Users folder. I have stopped sharing the other folders and re-shared them giving all permissions to Everyone, but all shared folders excepting Users gives a \"You do not have permission to access...\" error.Meanwhile, Computer B can see Computer A on the network, but cannot see any of the shared folders; the error is \"The network path was not found.\"I've spent hours on this and I'm desperate. Any help is appreciated.","\"Everyone, but all shared folders excepting Users gives a \"You do not have permission to access...\"I wrote my instructions to make shares look something like it was with Homegroup and use only Users folder, where OS set security settings.Do you have same user name on both PC's? Then this shouldn't have any problem.Share to Everyone make folder available, but Security settings define who can access to folders. Make these settings can be little tricky at first and tests is better to do with some temporary folder. \u00a0Left: Access only named User. Middle: Access to all who have user account in this PC.You can change these rights: Click Edit, and Add.\u00a0Enter User name to whom you want to give access.\"The network path was not found.\"Did you edit that hosts -table Step 6.2?
