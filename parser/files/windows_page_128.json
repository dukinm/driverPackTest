This is already a long lasting issue (more than one year). There is no indication to any behaviour pattern. The BSOD comes suddenly without warning, no dependency to any application I am using (no games). Just only the feeling, that after wakeup from sleep mode, the probability of the event increases.Environment: Win7 64bit SP1 on HP Elitebook 8440pMeasures taken: from the beginning of the memory extension to 5GB I knew, that one of the RAM modules had a problem with one address - memtest failed. It seemed, that it had no effect on the functionality of the notebook. But, since the BSOD problem started, I exchanged my RAM module and memtest is OK now.Internet research: revealed, that Windows generates kernel memory dump, which can be analysed and used to identify the problem. Further research showed, that this kind of problem can be caused by obsolete drivers or broken USB devices attached to the notebook.Situation: I admit, that I don't care much about newest drivers, because in most cases I don't need the extra functionality, however I have no problem to update one, if I would know, which one.I am looking for: a help from a professional, who is able to interpret attached dumps and say, which one of the drivers is causing the problem, similar to this post(DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL) BSOD caused by ntoskrnl.exeAttached evidence: kernel memory dumps with IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL errors in ntoskrnl.exe and MSinfo32 reportLink to attached evidence","solutions":["As nobody helped here, I was forced to do it yourself method.Procedure:As I knew, I have some bad driver on my PC I investigated further the topic and foundDriver Verifier tool from Microsoft:https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/windows_10-update\/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving\/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983https:\/\/mikemstech.blogspot.com\/2011\/12\/enable-driver-verifier-to-help-identify.htmlhttps:\/\/www.sevenforums.com\/tutorials\/101379-driver-verifier-enable-disable.htmlThis tool makes it possible to provide further details in case of\u00a0ntoskrnl.exe failures.
