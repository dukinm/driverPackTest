Today i saw an option to update to Windows 10 1909 . I want to know if there will be any sort of problem if I directly update my system to Windows 10 1909?I also want to know that do problems in Windows 10 1903 still exist like high CPU usage , wifi error etc. because with every update fix microsoft was releasing regarding \"May Update 1903\" more new issues were being reported by user. Will it be safe to install windows 10 1903?","solutions":["Hello SK123, i'm Timon and i'm glad to help you. There should not be a problem to update to 1909 directly. That's said, updates are an extremely complex mechanism and nobody can guarantee you there will be no problem this time.As always, if you are not confident, you can delay this update, and wait for the potential issues to be solved.","I want to know if there will be any sort of problem if I directly update my system to Windows 10 1909?That's impossible to know now ... which is why the smart way to install a new version of Windows is - and always has been - to\u00a0wait at least 3 months. Let corporate testers and professional reviewers uncover the early problems that are inevitable in any major update to an operating system, and give Microsoft an opportunity to fix them.If you want to keep up with the latest bugs, and Microsoft's progress towards fixing them, you need only consult the web page on Microsoft's own website where they provide all that information. For v.1909 you can find that here:Windows 10, version 1909 and Windows Server, version 1909After approximately 3 months, or even longer, consult that web page and see if there are any unresolved bugs that could affect your particular configuration. If there are none, then you can feel safe in allowing Microsoft Update to install the update for you.Only Directly's 'independent advisors' will tell you to install a new feature update as soon as possible, and to install directly from Microsoft's website instead of waiting for Microsoft Update, because they're competing for cash awards from Directly.I also want to know that do problems in Windows 10 1903 still exist like high CPU usage , wifi error etc.The number 1 rule for updating a computer is:\u00a0\u00a0Don't update over a problem. Solve your problems first, then update. The only reason to update over a problem is if the update solves a specific problem that you are experiencing. For the v.1903 update, you can see if your specific problem is solved by v.1909 here:Windows 10, version 1903 and Windows Server, version 1903Otherwise, if your existing problems are caused by unsupported hardware or software, or configuration mistakes (for which I am famous,) or malware, solve the problems first.(The number 2 rule for updating a computer is:\u00a0Backup before you start.)","Thank you sir... It really helped me to think in right direction that I shouldn't update.\u00a0","Thank sir..\u00a0","In general, I agree with S-and-S. Also, MS generally does \"phased\" rollouts so you may or may not get the upgrade (feature update) right away.In my case, I have a desktop with very old hardware (though current nVidia GPU driver) running Win10 Pro, a nearly 10-year-old laptop running Win10 Home, and a very cheap 2-in-1 running Win10 Home. All were on 1903 fully updated as of November Patch Tuesday. 1909 showed up in Windows Update as an \"optional update\" in both the laptop and the tablet within the first week; I went ahead and installed it in them (no critical unbacked-up data) and it seems to be working fine.It hasn't been offered to the desktop yet. There's apparently no way to tell when that will happen; in the past, I have sometimes had to do a manual install of a feature update from media after several months, which has almost always worked fine (once, I had to restore from an image backup, wait a bit, and try again; forget which one that was). So, yes, always do an image backup before doing a feature update, preferably the week before it becomes publicly available; it's your ultimate recovery mechanism.1909 is odd, though; unlike previous feature updates, it doesn't wipe out the previous \"version\" - 1903 is still there. Not sure what that is all about. The stories about it being a relatively minor \"service pack,\" rather than a full replacement as in the past, may be correct - essentially a cumulative update on steroids.In general, if you're on the current version (1903 at this point) prior to the latest feature release, it's safe to wait as long as the release of the next feature update. You'll still get monthly updates to that previous version. After that, not so much; MS treats Win10 computers sort of like phones, and all support for a feature level gets dropped within a couple of years of its release for non-Enterprise users. Also, they do have different approaches for different hardware, so I'm content to give them a few months to figure my olde beastie out. IOW, it's early days so Don't Panic.","I currently have windows 10 1809. Today i saw an option to update to Windows 10 1909 . I want to know if there will be any sort of problem if I directly update my system to Windows 10 1909?I also want to know that do problems in Windows 10 1903 still exist like high CPU usage , wifi error etc. because with every update fix microsoft was releasing regarding \"May Update 1903\" more new issues were being reported by user. Will it be safe to install windows 10 1903?","About all I can say is that I had 1903 (May 2019 update) on all 3 of my computers - a desktop, a laptop, and a tablet\/2-in-1. It worked OK on all of them (only the tablet, the newest, got it right away, though; the laptop was a little later). Of those 3, 1909 is now installed on 2 and working OK. It hasn't been offered to the desktop yet. The desktop (a 13-year-old beast with a Core2 Extreme and 8G RAM) was the last to get 1903, too, though the delay after the others was only a few weeks.If you're coming from 1809, I'd strongly recommend doing a full backup - data and image - before upgrading. And yes, from yours it would be an upgrade - full replacement. You'll probably have to reinstall any software that's not part of Windows or from the Windows Store. That's because from 1809 it'll install 1903 first, then the 1909 update. You want that backup (on a separate drive, of course) so you have the ability to roll back if things break.I never had the problems with 1903 some people complained about. So perhaps that was a \"do you feel lucky\" situation, and I got lucky. There are no guarantees in the computer game - you take precautions so you can restore to a known working point if things break, then try it.","I don't know whether server is having a problem but I do know that 1909 is having the same damn problem with the 100% cpu usage as in earlier updates.\u00a0 This time I have not been able to resolve the issue.\u00a0 This truly sucks.\u00a0 You have high end systems and they crawl like running windows ME.\u00a0Thank God I have linux and OSX systems because windows will always be a garbage os.","Thank You so much.\u00a0"]},{"symptom":"Activation        Is there any way to pay for an activation without re-installing the operating system?

I also believe that this is due to a virus. Running out of options, i decided to completely reset my laptop. When doing this, it stopped at 64% and started going into a boot loop. After some research, I decided on going with a fresh install of Windows 10 via a flash drive. The problem is, that I can only boot from UEFI and not Legacy because whenever i do, it says no bootable device could be found. And UEFI only recognizes the Fat32 format, and I cant put anything bigger than 4 gigs on that format so its not possible to boot from it since a specific file on the Windows 10 .iso is bigger than 4 gigs. I really dont know what to do anymore because i've spent countless hours trying all different formats and messing around with the settings and cant get anything to work. Im using a 16gig flashdrive, and the only other PC i have is a Mac which inconveniences things more. Thank you to anyone who reads this and any help is appreciated. If you have any questions, let me know. Thanks!EDIT: First I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who helped me out while I was having this issue. But it turns out that Dell has a Windows 10 .iso on their website and for some reason it seems to be slightly altered so that no individual file is over 4 gigs compared to the original Win 10 .iso on the official Microsoft website.

I thought Windows Defender was turned on but apparently it wasn't even though I'm sure it was on a couple months ago. When I went to turn it on, there was an error message saying something about having to be an admin to turn it on even though I double checked to see if I was an admin and I'm the only account on there. Being pretty inexperienced with computers and such, some of my friends and I also tried going through all my files, seeing if there was anything out of the ordinary, but found nothing.

First and foremost... It is my computer Microsoft. If I have a button on a controller I WANT to use or a feature I do not want to use, I should be able to choose. I really despise the direction modern tech companies are going in this regard. Quit designing stuff for lazy morons, they can learn to do everything just like everyone else.Anyways.....I use a front end on my pc to launch games and media, on top of the front end I use a thing called rocket launcher that allows me to have universal controls of all media and applications. It adds stuff like universal controller profiles, universal pause screens, fancy load\/exit screens, etc etc. RocketLauncher works just fine... MY CONTROLLER DOES NOTThe way I have it set up, button 11 on the controller (the guide button) is supposed to launch my \"Pause Screen\". It doesn't do this anymore. It launches the stupid game bar **** no one needed or asked for. I want to control the guide button and what it does or does not do. (I also want an easy way to permanently disable stoopid features like the \"game bar\" but that is an entirely different topic)What I have tried...I unselected \"open game bar using this button on a controller\", no fixI turned off the game bar in settings\/gaming, no fix but did re-allow other apps that used the guide button for a function to use it againI downloaded Xbox Accessories and tried to reconfigure the controller to my liking\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 no fix, the guide button isn't even an option\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 (Also it would be AMAZING if you could do keyboard binds to buttons.

Everything works as intended on my windows 7 machine and my wife's Windows 8 tablet. Windows 10 really does improve upon a lot of things but it fails in just about the same number of areas. Please quit trying to force people to use their computers how YOU think we should. Freedom MUST remain a top priority, otherwise, everything else is utterly pointless.I really don't like using this ps4 controller, it feels wrong in my hands so hopefully someone can help me out.
