This hasn't occurred once in the normal operating of the PC outside of when I'm playing video games, and it's never happened previously when using my HDD on Windows 7. So here's the timeline of events:I recently updated from Windows 7 to Windows 10 about a week ago, and then shortly after that I got a Samsung 860 EVO SSD and cloned it from my existing HDD. When I play counter strike utilizing my newly cloned SSD as my new boot drive, the computer shuts down on it's own within ~30 minutes, it reboots normally and then shows Kernel 41 critical error in the Event Viewer. I initially thought this was more likely to be related to my newly installed Windows 10 rather than my new SSD, but I just booted Windows 10 through my HDD and played Counter Strike for a few hours without a single issue, so now I'm inclined to think it's the new SSD and not Windows 10. I cloned the SSD from my HDD using Samsung Data Migration and then just started booting off the SSD.\u00a0One other interesting quirk is that occasionally when I'm booting up my computer when it's using the new SSD as the boot drive, sometimes the computer will turn on, turn off about 2-4 seconds later, and then turn itself on again another 2-4 seconds later and it'll boot totally normally on this second attempt.\u00a0I've tried every step in this link and pretty much anything else I can find on Kernel 41 errors.https:\/\/windowsreport.com\/kernel-power-41-error-windows-10\/My computer is a bit old, but given it's been working totally fine until this new SSD was utilized it makes me think it's unlikely to be a hardware issue.

The way the computer crashes has come in two forms. While both forms result in a Kernel 41 error in the Event Viewer, half of the crashes have fully come by totally shutting down my desktop and my desktop losing power. The other half of the crashes have just resulted in a massive computer freeze, where the computer still has power, but it's totally frozen and nothing works (no CTRL ALT DEL or anything). In this latter state, I tried letting the computer sit like that for 15 minutes and it just stays frozen, so eventually I have to power it off and start it back up so the end result from my perspective is effectively the same.\u00a0","Hi Marty, I am Rob, an independent and a 14 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis.
