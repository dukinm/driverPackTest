I am a seasoned Windows expert with almost a decade in usage and support experience and hope to resolve your problems quickly.When all of your electronics appear lagspikes of some kind then the problem likely is with your connection and not with device settings. Moreover since you tried it with a cable the problem isnt any adapter or signal interference.I would look at the endpoint of your network for the cause of trouble. Update the router firmware if outdated to keep intruders out. If you measured this thoroughly already the best will be to also contact your provider about the issue.Your provider ought to deliver some kind of stable connection or he might breach his contract.If the provider denys the problem you got to take measurements by metering your connection to then use the evidence but for now informing them about the problem might be just enough for them to look for it.If you consider your problem solved it would be very good if you marked the answer which helped you so others can find and use this thread.If this didn't solve your problem or you need further assistance please answer in this thread and i would be happy to help.kind regards F.
