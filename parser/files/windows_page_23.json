{"windows":[{"symptom":"Inspiron 7386 Wifi throttling with Intel 9560        I have a Dell Inspiron 7386 which is about 11 month old so still under the basic 1 year warranty when the wifi started being very unreliable a kept dropping and even not finding the adapter at all. I returned the laptop to Dell who replaced the adapter and the motherboard.I am finding that if the laptop had been in sleep mode, the speed to a NAS drive was severely restricted as per CrystalMark[Read] Sequential 1MiB): 1.677 MB\/s [Write] Sequential 1MiB: 4.404 MB\/sI found that if I Enabled and Disabled the 9560 Adapter, full speed was returned:[Read] Sequential 1MiB: 31.876 MB\/s [Write] Sequential 1MiB: 37.543 MB\/sYesterday I spent 5 hrs on the phone with Dell support and did not resolve the problem. This included a restore of an original Win10 image and resetting the router. Other laptops in the house do not have the problem.We have replaced drivers and changed some BIOS settings but not solution yet.I pay for 80mbps download and 20 mbps upload and this is reduced to 20 and 20 unless I disable\/enable the adapter every time the PC wakes from sleep. I store Pictures\/Videos\/Backups on the NAS so this extends the access time by over a factor of 10 and in fact can't play 4K video as the speed is too slow at 1.7MB\/s.Dell confirm that this is not normal, but with a new motherboard, wifi adapter, and clean install, I'm stuck.If I set the power \/ sleep option on battery to Always Disconnect on sleep, it does resolve the problem if the PC is not charging. If it's charging, it going into throttled mode, but resolves itself if it then sleeps on battery mode.This is a crude workaround, but saves me disabling and enabling everytime it sleeps.I have trid a different router and the problem persists, and my wife's laptop is also fine.Any suggestions - sorry it's a bit long!RichardWindows 10 Home verion 1909 - latest update","solutions":["Hi Richard.

Even if you've tried some of these steps already please do them over in sequence to see if it makes as difference:Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.

Most of them I have tried, but shall recheck.The element that I don't understand is that with a new fresh image Windows 10 from the Dell repair facility when they fitted a new adapter and motherboard, I stll had the problem.I don't know where it is occuring - Dell Hardware or Windows Software or the Plusnet One router.I thought I had tested the router as my wife has no issues with her Dell laptop,This maybe a red herring but looking at the Network with a bit of windows software I compared three senarios.1 On Battery with full speed2 Running throttled on Power 2 Running properly on power after a disable\/enable of adapter.There is a difference in the Device Type and Service Type with the full speed at one setting and throttled (centre panel) on another. - I don't really know what I'll doing here!","If the adapter was replaced by Dell under warranty then they must get it working.The steps I gave usually resolve most normal issues with getting network connected. But this may be something related to the adapter itself. You can test this by plugging in an inexpensive USB nano adapter such as the one suggested.Please do not skip any steps. We often find out later that the fix was the skipped step. If you need help performing any step I will help.","I am working through the list, but no luck so far. I agree that it's looking like the adapter as I have tried a couple of n 2.4G usb adapters and I can't reproduce the problem. However, if I use the 2.4G SSID (I have 5G and 2.4G\u00a0 split into two), I can't reproduce the problem either, so it's a 5G issue.As for Dell, I didn't quite give the full story, they have actually had the PC back twice and replaced the wifi card twice. It passes the windows diagnostic test, so they say it's OK.I have also extended the Dell warranty with the Premium edition for another 12 months which is a home visit rather than collect and return which took about 3 weeks.I have now set the on power sleep mode to never and the battery mode to always disconnect the network when sleeping. It now auto resets if it slips into throttling mode.Have you come across this before? I would like to set the on power sleep mode to Disconnect too, but there isn't a setting.Thanks for your helpRichard","See how to adjust your Power Plan settings here: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2843-change...Do other devices on your network get a successful 5g connection?","Thanks again, I shall experiment with some of the PowerCFG options.No, other PC's using the 5G SSID don't have a problem either.It is interesting that if I try and add extra power plans, the system drops one so I only ever can see two listed. There maybe a small corruption in the registry here .My setting of AWAYS disconnect wifi on battery sleepandNEVER sleep when plugged in catches most options which mitigates the problem largely. If I plug in when in sleep mode it fails, but at the sleep, it resets again.My new Dell warranty doesn't cut in for a few week so\u00a0 shall see how this works.Thanks againRichard","To find the missing Power Plans, right click the battery icon in System tray at right end of Task Bar, choose Windows Mobility Center, then Battery Status, choose the one you want to display.Go into Device Manager, open Network Adapters, then Wifi adapter. On the Power Management tab experiment with the checkboxes to see if they are interfering. These are different for each controller.Also have you assured you have the latest driver for the device from Dell, then compared it with the stock driver from the device manufacturer? I'd even try older drivers to see if one can be made to work. These may be queued at Wifi Driver tab > Update Driver > Browse > Let Me pick.","Thanks again for your help and suggestions. I am surprised this is being so difficult! This was a current production model till very recently and is still available new so rolling back drivers shouldn't be necessary.My workaround setup works well enough for now and if it becomes a problem, I shall go back to Dell Support when the Premium level kicks in.I have ordered a USB adapter anyway. My instinct is that it's the wifi adapter again, but done of the dell hardware tests confirm this. I'm 99.99% sure it's not the router or the NAS unit. .It is easily reproducible by changing the Network Connection on Battery in the Power and Sleep settings from ALWAYS to NEVER and pushing the power button to SLEEP (no power connected), wait 30secs, and wake up. It's then throttled. Disable\/Enable the wifi adapter and it's OK again. I use a shortcut which runs:C:\\Windows\\System32\\netsh.exe interface set interface name=\"WiFi\" admin = disabledand again with 'enable'.This other curious thing is there are no other reports of this, so that suggests - hardware.Richard","Richard, I agree that hardware is the likely culprit and will be interested to hear if the problem reproduces itself with the new USB nano adapter.One thing you may not have tried yet is thoroughly troubleshoot Sleep to see if that checklist turns up anything at fault. I will give you all possible fixes for Sleep. If you need help performing any step just ask back:First confirm you have the Sleep options configured correctly as shown here: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2843-change....You might want to try Hibernate to succeed Sleep, or use Hibernate in place of Sleep - it's just a deeper sleep that actually powers off because desktop stored in RAM during sleep is written to hard drive hiberfile then powered off. When it starts up it loads the hiberfile and starts faster. Most Sleep problems are caused by the Display driver, so try updating yours from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag. While there make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Network, Sound, USB and all other drivers by comparing those posted for download with the version and date of the corresponding ones in the Device Manager.If that doesn't help then in Device Manager on Display device Driver tab choose Roll back, Uninstall (then restart to reinstall) or try another one previously installed at Device Manager>Display adapter>Driver>Update Driver>Browse>Let me pick.In addition there are steps here to specifically troubleshoot Sleep mode problems:http:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/fix-windows-10-sle... What I do is go into Advanced Power options and set Display and Sleep to 1 minutes, Hibernate to 2 minutes, then after completing each step restart the PC and observe what happens for 3 minutes.Also did it previously work? Do you have a System Restore point from when it did?http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t...This may have been caused by Windows Updates.

Then if an Update reinstalls and causes the same problem uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:https:\/\/www.askvg.com\/fixing-windows-10-automat... If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.That message normally means that someone has activated Windows with a KMS or Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.Sometimes this is done by shops reinstalling Windows, unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS\/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated by free Upgrade or a retail Product Key, and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install, the factory key embedded in the UEFI\/BIOS firmware chip, or the retail key you used. Then we'll see if it activates:1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for your licensed version from here:http:\/\/winaero.com\/blog\/generic-key-to-install-...This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:If it doesn't activate after going online and you originally had factory installed Windows, read the Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware chip at the factory by running ProducKey:http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/produkey-x64.zip, copy and paste the OEM-BIOS key (only) into Settings> Update & Security > Activation.If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it. You can report this to Microsoft here:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/howtotell\/cfr\/r.... In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.You can also contact the seller and let him\/her know you are taking these actions and that they need to make the activation good. Many will comply rather than risk investigation or prosecution.For further assistance restoring the original legal activation you can contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/...

May I ask why you rated me unhelpful before I even had the chance to reply? I said I would keep helping until it's resolved. I do have to sleep.What are you trying to do exactly when you get the error - you have never said. Are you trying to activate Windows?If so then restore the Generic key if you've tried any other. It will not affect your files. But of course your files should be backed up at all times anyway or they are valued at nothing.Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice. Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:1) You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder using OneDrive Backup, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/116029-turn... 2) Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15gb for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en-GB_ALL\/drive\/dow... 3) In addition I'd have an on-site hard copy backup. The best way to do this is to sort all of your files into their User folders and then drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive. Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files: https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/2086566\/the-man... 4) Besides your files you should save a System Image back up to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:http:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/howto\/7363\/macrium-ref... You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.I hope this helps.

This installation was a success, and worked well for weeks without any problem - excepting some disk check when booting Windows.But recently, I encountered what I saw as called \"Automatic Repair Loop\" on the Internet : Windows does not manage to boot, it restarts the computer after one minute of white turning circles and then I see a screen with \"Preparing Automatic Repair\" for a few seconds. Then, the screen goes black and... Nothing more happens. I let this \"repair\" run for 6 hours without any success too.I can't access to the Troubleshoot menu : at the second hard reboot, I automatically enter in the Automatic Repair mode that I definitely can't avoid.It is important to say that I'm currently using the exact same computer on OpenSUSE, so I don't think I'm facing a hardware problem here. I just can't boot on Windows.I decided to create a Windows USB drive to repair\/recover\/reinstall Windows 10. I downloaded the Windows 10 iso, used WoeUSB to install it on a key, then configured my BIOS to boot on it.I saw the white dots turning as in the initialization of Windows 10, but after some seconds, the screen goes black and nothing else happens.The installation usb drive does not work either, and I don't understand how it is possible.So, I'm currently stuck on my 40 GB OpenSUSE distribution, and I definitely need to access to my windows folders and applications...I don't remember any event that could have led to this situation. I think Windows has been up to date for a while.Do you guys have any idea about a way to boot on this installation usb drive ? I would really, really appreciate some help.Thanks for reading, I'm waiting for a possible answer, and I stay here for any more piece of information that could be useful.","solutions":["Hello Yarkane, my name is Farah and I'm an Independent Adviser.
