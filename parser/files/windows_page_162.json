The problem is reproducible, and happens with both wireless (USB) and wired (USB) mouse and keyboard.If I use the \"Start - Power - Shutdown\" command, then power back up, all is well.The system is not frozen, just the mouse and keyboard, as I can shut it down using a remote controller like TeamViewer.Hoping to find a solution other than a full refresh - just spent the last 3 weeks loading up the system with my apps.","solutions":["Hi Curler, Did this happen after an update?

Unfortunately theres no way to get around your password being forgotten. You will need to reset your PC back to its initial state. To do this you dont need a Windows 10 usb, you just need to let the computer run until it reaches the log in screen, then press and hold the shift key while you tell it to reboot via the power options in the lower right corner. This will load the advanced recovery options.From here choose Advanced Options and Reset. You can keep all your personal data this way and will reset the computer to a state with no password.You will need to reinstall all programs and reset settings such as web browsers, favorites, stored passwords ect.This way you'll have your computer back.Take Care,Andrew","Hi again.
