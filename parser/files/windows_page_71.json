Here's what happened:I was using Spotify one day and my computer started hanging. So I restarted the computer via the Start menu.The computer went into automatic repair and then automatic repair failed. I disabled automatic repair using bcdedit and rebooted.Then the computer went into Windows recovery. When I was exploring the different options on recovery, I noticed that some of them requested for the Bitlocker recovery key before I could proceed.This was the first time I knew of BitLocker\u2019s existence, so I definitely did not activate BitLocker manually. I\u2019m not sure how my internal SSD contents got encrypted on their own.I tried solutions like secure boot in BIOS, resetting BIOS settings to their defaults, all with no luck. At one point I also re-enabled Automatic repair.Now, when the affected computer is booted up, I am brought to the BitLocker recovery screen.Based on my reading and conversations with Microsoft Tech Support, when a Windows 10 Home computer is purchased, and the user signs in to a Microsoft account on first startup, BitLocker is setup automatically.\u00a0So I went to that same Microsoft account that I used to setup the affected computer.Sure enough, my device was listed there:It even told me BitLocker was ON when I clicked \u201cManage\u201d.However when I clicked \u201cManage recovery key\u201d and I got past the 2 factor authentication, I got this\u2026? It seems that no recovery key is associated with my account. But how is that possible given that this was the correct account that was used to setup the device, the device is listed in the account, and it even tells me BitLocker ON?Regarding the other possibilities where BitLocker recovery keys may be found:The hyperlinks\u00a0https:\/\/onedrive.live.com\/recoverykey,\u00a0aka.ms\/recoverykey also don't work.This is a home computer, so the recovery key cannot be on Azure Active Directory services.Since BitLocker was activated by itself, there\u2019s also no way the recovery key could be on a printout.I\u2019ve already checked all my USB drives and no recovery key was present. The data in my computer is valuable so\u00a0I can't afford to format the disk.Could someone help?

Try running that first. 2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service: Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key.net stop wuauserv net stop cryptSvc net stop bits net stop msiserver Ren C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old Ren C:\\Windows\\System32\\catroot2 Catroot2.old net start wuauserv net start cryptSvc net start bits net start msiserver Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then 3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:http:\/\/test.catalog.update.microsoft.com\/v7\/sit... 4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/224471\/how-to-prevent... 5) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 6) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open installed Tool and choose to Upgrade the PC Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version 1909. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... _____________________ Good news! There are major changes in Version 1903 giving back control over Updates to the consumer. Microsoft has heard us at the highest level who announced this here:https:\/\/blogs.windows.com\/windowsexperience\/201..._____________________ I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

Specifically, I skipped #4, because I don't want to block the updates that didn't work. Maybe I don't fully understand how the update process works, but why would anyone want to skip an update, especially a major one, that could potentially leave a security hole in their operating system? This is not a criticism; this is just my train of thought, and my nervousness about doing something that sounds (to me) very serious.I am in the process of using the Media Creation Tool to upgrade my computer. By the way, just FYI, here are my system specs:ASUS\u00a0 ROG STRIXModel G531GT-BI7N6Intel Model 9462NGW (9th Gen Intel Core i7-9750H mobile processor @ 2.6 Ghz)16.0 GB RAM (According to Amazon, original model came with 8 GB, but I have confirmed that mine is 16 GB.)NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 graphics w\/ 4GB GDDR5 dedicated video memory\u00a0Windows 10 Home Version 1903 Build 18362.30It's basically a brand new computer; it was a Christmas gift. It works fine, but I worry that it's not up to date, especially since my son also has the exact same computer (also a Christmas gift), and his has already downloaded and installed the update.","UPDATE: Tried the tool, it worked. When tool was finished, my version was 1909 build 18363.418.Then I ran update again, to check for updates, and it found two, one of which was the update that caused this ticket in the first place (2019-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems (KB4530684) )I downloaded and installed both updates successfully, and it now says that my system is up-to-date.Currently, I am at: Version 1909 Build 18363.535.I am a very happy camper now. The media tool solved my problem, and kept all of my custom apps and settings in place. I highly recommend this option to anyone else having the same issue.Cheers!","Hi, having looked at community stuff I am afraid that you all seem to think that every one with problems is a smart and tech savy as you obviously are.\u00a0 Could I request with all sincerity that you direct me to somewhere where people like me with absolutely NO\u00a0 IT skills what so ever can look for help with problems.\u00a0I have tried to keep my pc safe and working properly\u00a0 but for months\u00a02019-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems has failed\u00a0 - apparently\u00a0 my device is missing important security and quality fixes.\u00a0I has tried to look up solutions on the internet\u00a0 but the cures(!) might as well be written in Chinese\u00a0 composed by\u00a0 an Eskimo ( no insults intended).Where do dummies like me go for help?\u00a0","Look at the original post above, by Vaidish. Option #6 was the one that worked for me, and it's very non-technical; you literally just download the program, run it, and choose \"Upgrade this machine.\" You don't have to configure anything or change any settings. It keeps all your settings, apps, and preferences as they were. I was very impressed with how well it worked.Barring that, show this thread to a family member or trusted, close friend who has computer knowledge, and let them help you go through the steps.As a last resort, you could take your machine to a local computer shop in your area, but be aware, there is often a large disparity in the knowledge level of shop owners. Some of those guys are true technicians with deep knowledge of their subject area; however, some of them are just proficient computer users with research skills, who are going to Google the problem, find this thread or a similar one, and go through the listed steps. Be sure the shop you go to has an actual, licensed technician on staff.Hope this helped!","Hey Greg!I've tried all the above options and yet no working solution... tried to use the media installer and at the very end it said the\u00a0installation failed.\u00a0"]},{"symptom":"When will there be a new activation code for win10 bedrock version\uff1f        See the exchange button but no activation code","solutions":["Hi,Please can you provide more information about the issue.
