This is Windows 10 on my Lenovo Yoga 910. Occassionally, my CPU will be working very hard and is generally at 100% usage. I can tell because my fan will be working hard for some time. Once I open Task Manager to see what is causing the problem, I will see a dramatic drop in my CPU usage. Below is a screenshot. This seems very odd to me that opening the Task Manager would decrease CPU usage. For a short bit I noticed that \"System Interrupts\" was at the top of the Processes organized by CPU usage in this instance. This isn't a terrible issue but it would be nice to not have these random CPU spikes.","solutions":["Hi Warpstar22 I'll try to answer your question.

For example preparing files for a further update, or rearanging files, or scanning for virus, etc.When you open the task manager, Windows stops the work that he was doing on hiw own because you're asking him to do something else.Also, system interrupts is a container that gets a lot of instructions from software \/ hardware. it handles a lot of interactions.I hope this answers your question Regards"]},{"symptom":"How do I change my windows password?

It makes any kind of media playback worthless. The audio and video are both effected during the stutters which last less than a second but occur about every 1-2 seconds.

Otherwise there are mbox to PST converters. You could convert it to a PST and then import it into outlook as a PST.","Thunderbird opened the first file (4743615.mbox) up exactly like notepad++ did. I.E.: It appears to be exactly as I posted in the first posting. There was the same human readable content and there also seems to be content that requires some script to be run on it to be readable.The other two Yahoo mbox files were opened by Thunderbird and revealed human readable content. Interestingly enough in Thunderbird, they were very short files in readable English. But, the size of the 4743615.mbox.00002 file is the same size as the 4743615.mbox file which was like 192k lines long. That seems strange and indicates loss of data!I went ahead and tried saving the cryptic data in my first posting to a file named test.mbox and loading that into Thunderbird. The file was shown with the cryptic text and wasn't human readable.Thanks,","Hi Christopher, you need to select each part of encoded text and paste it into https:\/\/www.base64decode.org\/ site.
