It usually happens when a quick motion happens on the screen; never when it's still. I highly doubt it's a internal problem in my monitor because when I had Linux this issue never occurred. Sometimes it just straight-up stays black until I exit out whatever I'm in (I've had to Alt+F4 a lot of things). It happens every other day as well, like say today it was working normal, tomorrow it wouldn't be working, but then the next day after that it would, and then repeat. And yes, I've checked (6 times at this point) that yes, my graphic drivers are in fact updated.

The only exceptions is (if it helps you to know the titles) Geometry Dash, which never works right (yes, I've reinstalled it multiple times) it flickers whether or not I've restarted. Even after the clean boot it only worked for a little longer than usual before it went back to flickering, and then there's The Joy of Creation: Story Mode (horror game FYI). The Joy of Creation has always worked, and has never flickers ONCE no matter what I've messed with its settings, it has always worked perfectly fine. The only difference with this one is I downloaded it after I activated Windows 10.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.1) How exactly did you check your Display adapter is latest? Running Update from Device Manager isn't even a start. Plus it's critical enough you may need to reinstall it, find another driver, an older driver, etc.Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS\/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.If this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here:http:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/support\/... or the Nvidia Update utility here: http:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/Download\/Scan.aspx?lang=e... or the AMD autodect utility here: http:\/\/support.amd.com\/us\/gpudownload\/windows\/P...

Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 4) Try running a Linux live distro from flash stick with the hard drive disconnected which will narrow the issue to the remaining hardware if it repeats, and if it doesn't then points to the hard drive or Windows install.

However when I click on it to import, it opens with Adobe Reader...\u00a0So, I checked the \"file association by type\" and discovered Adobe Reader was assigned to the ris file extension.Now the fun part... It will not allow me (give me the option to remove or change) from Adobe to Endnote. It will only allow me to select Adobe or The Microsoft Apps. Even scarier is that a second extension used by Endnote is associated\u00a0 correctly..Any help would be appreciated","solutions":["Hi, I'm David an independent advisor and user just like you. I'll do my best to help you with this.If you right-click one of these files in Explorer, you should have an \"Open with..\" option half way down the menu - click that - in the next window scroll all the way to the bottom of the list of options and you should have \"Look for another app on this PC\".If you use that option it will let you manually locate the executable for Endnote so you can associate it with the file type. It looks like you'd find the executable in the path \"C:\\Program Files\\Reference Manager X\", although I'm not familiar with this particular app. Also if you tick the \"Always use this app to open .ris files\" it will stop them going to Adobe permanently.Regards, David","GHi David,, thanks for the quick reply..

SSDs do not need optimization and Windows does detect if there is an SSD. In fact, doing an optimization on an SSD affects it's health. Hence Windows isn't running the same.2. Even if it was an HDD in the PC if there isn't enough data you do not need defragmentation. 2\/3% doesn't matter.Hope that helps.","What is yours showing? This is mine and I don't worry about it.

THIS IS FOR WINDOWS 10 EDITION ONLYI have had this problem and have fixed it using this method (couldn't find anything to help so i figured it out then made this, so you won't have to figure it out yourself).\u00a0Just so you now my problem occurred because i had a power outage as my world was saving after i closed it. I don't know if it may work for you, but best to give it a shot, it's short and easy.First off open Minecraft and make a new world (give the world the same settings as you old one, as the settings will change after the process). Save and close and save the world, then close Minecraft.Then, open files explorer. go: This PC\/Local Disk (C:)\/Users\/User\/AppData\/Local\/Packages\/Microsoft.MinecraftUWP_8wekyb3d8bbwe\/LocalState\/games\/com.mojang\/minecraftWorldsIf you have trouble finding the folder try this:\u00a0https:\/\/help.ableton.com\/hc\/en-us\/articles\/209070509-How-to-access-hidden-folders\u00a0\u00a0It is easier if you only had one world (I did) but there should be two (maybe more for you) folders in the minecraftWorlds folder that has a few random looking characters. As I said I only had one world so for me there was two folders, my old lost world and the new world I had just created. If you have more than two folders you may just have to do some trial and error, although they are in order of creation with oldest being at the top, newest at the bottom (the bottom-most folder is your new world).\u00a0Open you newest world folder (the one you made earlier) go to the db folder, delete everything in there (not the db folder itself. Go to your lost worlds folder, go to the db folder (for me there was another \"lost\" folder in db, that's fine). Copy everything in the db folder, including the \"lost\" folder. Go to your new world folder, go to the db folder, paste the contents from the old db folder into the new.\u00a0Open Minecraft, go to worlds (the world should still be called \"My World\", you can edit it later). Open the new world and you should find it has become your old world.I hope this helps !

The ability to change keyboard layout: currently, it only supports the most popular layout (English 101\/102 keys.) Living in Japan, all of my laptops and keyboards have the same Japanese 106\/109 keys layout and it's really hard to type using the new native Vietnamese input because they have different key locations.\u00a02. The English input mode is brilliant since it supports multiple hardware keyboard layouts; you can add a new layout just with a few simple clicks and switch between them easily. Why can't other language inputs (such as Japanese or Vietnamese) do the same thing? The Japanese input mode allows you to switch between English and Japanese layouts, but it requires a full system restart!3. There's also this annoying bug: cloned words\/characters when typing in 3rd party applications such as chrome.I would appreciate greatly if the developers could take some time to look into these suggestions.\u00a0Thank you.","solutions":["Hi Minh,\u00a0Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.\u00a0I appreciate your interest in Microsoft products.
