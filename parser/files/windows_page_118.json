From the little I\u2019ve learned, I think the beginning part of the address identifies the network\/router and the end of the address identifies the specific computer.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, that can hide the actual unique address ( MAC) of the computer for privacy reasons.So, if I\u2019m right about that (and I have no idea if I am), I assume I need to block a range of addresses.I don\u2019t know how to block any IPv6 address, or a range of IPv6 addresses.Can anyone help me?I am using a Microsoft surface pro 4 (which may not matter) running Windows 10 Pro","solutions":["Hello, my name is Arif Ahmed, Windows Advisor.

Click Properties Uncheck IPv6 Apply > OK","My Gmail password might even have been changed ...I don't understand. How could you\u00a0not know if your password was changed? After all, it'syour password that you chose. Moreover, Google confirms all changed passwords by sending you an email, to make sure that it's you who changed your password. Did you get a changed password email from Google?The activity seems to be coming from an iPv6 address (2600:1010:b02b:a303:9831:My friend, you must never take drastic action on a hunch. Trust me, I tried that. Did not work out well. You need to be\u00a0certain that this unspecified suspicious activity came from that IP address before you block it. That could turn out to be an important address that should not be blocked. Or you could make a mistake while messing around in something with which you are admittedly not familiar (been there - done that) and cause harm to your computer. Particularly since an IPv6 address haseight groups of hexadecimal numbers, and the address you're showing us only has five.","I don\u2019t blame you for implying that I\u2019m an idiot because I didn\u2019t give you enough detail.I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m not sure my password was changed. I always leave myself logged into Gmail on all my devices, so I don\u2019t need to login every time I use Gmail. However, for reasons that I won\u2019t bother to go into now, I wanted to temporarily turn off two step verification. For that, I DID need to enter my password. However, when I tried to, it said it was incorrect password. I know it was the correct one, because I have my correct password written down (in code) and I had Gmail display the password I was typing in. This happened twice. Obviously, this is extremely suspicious. The weird thing is though that I never got a password change notification from Gmail. So, how did my password change without my being notified?\u00a0The only explanations I could figure out were:Some glitch by Google., The probability of this happening twice seems extremely remote. However, I am having other funky things going on with Google: trying to reenter changed PW on my iOS devices, i keep getting message \u201csomething went wrong\u201d.Whatever Computer\/automated process had broken into my Gmail intercepted the change notification and permanently deleted it.Frankly, neither of those seems super likely to me, but what do I know?When I checked the Devices that had accessed my Gmail, I saw the one that I said I\u2019m trying to block. Since this IP address has actually gone into my Gmail, unless it\u2019s one of my devices, I should think I\u2019m OK to completely block it.I checked all my other devices, and the suspicious IP address doesn\u2019t look like any of the IP addresses on those devices. However, because I\u2019m very unfamiliar with IPv6 I wanted to double check that the beginning part of the IPv6 address identifies the network. If that\u2019s so, then this address I want to block is definitely NOT one of my devices.","Forgive me, but if you're having a problem with GMail, why not contact Google? I don't think you're an idiot; I just think you're going about this in the wrong way.To block a single IP address or a range of IP addresses, enter your router's administration utility. Each brand of router has a different setup for its administration utility, but you will eventually find the screen where you can block connections from specified IP addresses.","You\u2019re absolutely right that I should contact Google, and that is the first thing that I did.I haven\u2019t heard back from them, and I doubt that I will. Based on a previous bad experience I had with Gmail, I discovered that Google does not give a damn about its users, and is perfectly willing to let them hang out to dry when they have a serious problem.I will try to figure out on my router how to block an IP address. However, I will be traveling, so the only way I can keep my PC secure then is by blocking the IP address in windows firewall.I\u2019m not sure what to put in as the address to Block. For IP4, it\u2019s no problem, I know what to do. But I don\u2019t know what to do for IPv6. As I said, from my very limited understanding of iPv6, there are parts of the address that are variable, even when using the same device, and there are parts of the address that are fixed, indicating the specific access point. That\u2019s why I need to know exactly how to enter the IPv6 address so that the firewall will block any attempted access from that device.","Sorry if I wasn\u2019t clear, but I do not want to disable IPv6, which is what this will do.I simply want the block a suspicious IP address from accessing my computer. I know how to block an IPV4 address, but I don\u2019t know how to block IPv6 address, because I do not fully understand the protocol. E.G. what parts of the full 8 group hexadecimal address needs to be specified to identify the device and how to specify a range of IPv6 addresses.\u00a0I want to know how to enter the iPv6 address in windows firewall to block it.","Got it. We can do this by creating a Firewall rule. Please perform the following: Open Windows Firewall Click On Advanced Settings (Left) Click on Inbound Rule (Left) Click on \"New Rule\" (Right) Select Custom Select Protocols and Ports Click on the drop down button under Protocol Type Select IPv6 > Next Select \"These IP addresses\" Click on Add Enter the IPv6 address Apply > OK","Thanks for your reply, but I already knew how to use windows firewall to block an IP address, but only for IPv4.\u00a0I apologize that I apparently have not been clear enough.My question is what do I need to enter as the IPv6 address to block.

This is the address that appears to have accessed my Gmailaccount and that I want to block: 2600:1010:b02b:a303:9831:2c02:b20b:ce45I have added that exact address to the addresses to be blocked. However, my limited understanding of IPv6 \u2013 which could easily be wrong \u2013 is that the same computer could try to access my account with a slightly different IPv6 address. For example, I have noticed that some of the IPv6 addresses for my iPhone vary from day today.That\u2019s why I want to know if I need to enter a range of IPv6 addresses to block, and if so exactly how I need to enter the range.","Harold, you need to add the exact IPv6 address to be blocked.

You need to open the newest version of Word which will also then be able to open all your previous files.To find Word click on START and type \"word\" on top of the Start menu - that will cause a search and the menu will find Word - if you click Word there it should open ok.Regards, David"]},{"symptom":"Ram usage at 50+% just from using windows 10        I have 16gb of RAM and on my desktop with noting booted up at all my pc is using 8gb of Ram.

I was advised when I bought my computer that with Windows 10 I can go back to the classic view we had in Windows 7 and before. Had a Windows 8 computer and never could use it or figure it out. Looked up instructions how to bring up classic view for the computer and in the new browser, whatever it's called, but they didn't work because the options I was told to click on weren't there. I want a classic start menu, files and folders, and toolbars in my browser. I hate Icons and pictures, I want words, and long listed menus with words. I took computer classes at Ohio State starting in 1983 and have been intimate with computers since. I had the choice to pick Apple or IBM\/Microsoft to start, and I chose the latter because of the complication and because\u00a0it afforded more information as to how everything worked. It was considered supposedly\u00a0much harder at the time, but more useful and was supposed to help get into the meat of the operating system. I loved it and found it very easy. Basic programming was a simple task.\u00a0Everything was super-smooth sailing compared to this new desktop and OS, and even DOS was less complicated. I don't understand why Microsoft is dissing its customers with these Apple-type new systems, but from everyone I've heard, it's difficult and frustrating. I don't know anyone who likes it.\u00a0The current setup is so simple yet inexplicable,\u00a0I can't do anything, and it's confusing and extremely aggravating. Any help would be greatly appreciated to get me back to a functional desktop. I'm about to chuck my new Alienware laptop out the window!!","solutions":["Hi,Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.We understand how you feel about the situation.
