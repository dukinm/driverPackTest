Windows version is Windows 10 x64 Enterprise, Version 1909 OS Build 10.0.18363.535 (Nov 2019 Update).The problem is that since I received the update the other day the search box is \"dead\". By that I mean that you can attempt to click inside it but no cursor appears when you do and typing does nothing.A \"fix\" (which is not a fix because the problem comes right back) is to open Task Manager, find the process named \"Windows Explorer\", right-click it and select \"Restart\". The search box will now work as expected for only for a random amount of time. Maybe 10 seconds, maybe 10 minutes.My work is seriously affected by this. Quickly searching for and finding the files I need are part of my normal workflow and this search box problem makes that impossible. What results is opening files one by one until I find the one I need. And that's only possible if I know what folder it's in, which is not always possible.I've resorted to using the 30-day trial version of Directory Opus, which has so many features that it has a little bit of a learning curve. Hopefully Microsoft will issue a fix for this problem in less than 30 days because I don't intend to pay $49 US to be able to search for files.With all that said, has anyone found a fix for this? I searched but all the results I get are people complaining about the problem and posting the same \"fix\" I found, which is restarting the Windows Explorer process.

In that case, FSX limitates the game time to about that durationIf that, the solution is easy (from my personal website about flightsim with the FS series of Microsoft):'The registration of the FSX firstly installed does not pose troubles, generally as the one of the Acceleration Pack does. Once installed and launching back FSX you may get a 1-80004005 error, which will limit the use of your FSX at 30 minute of time. The solution, which is widely given on the Internet, resides into a faulty entry of the Windows Registry. To fix that, run 'regedit' from Cortana and launch that utility. It will show you the registry content. CAUTION, THAT CONTAINS SENSITIVE DATA! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT FOLLOWS! Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\CONTROL\\CLASS\\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}.

Either you will find a '0' value; change it too to 'PartMgr' and idem. Or, at last, you may find other values of which 'partmgr'; some advice to first backup tall those, then erase everything except 'partmgr' (you will turn to 'PartMgr'; exit idem, and once the registration performed, you may paste the backup back).
