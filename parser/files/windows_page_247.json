On some I can use a workaround by copying the link then selecting 'Paste and Go' as a browser entry, but not all. In one case the failed workaround was to change a password due to old one being lost, so was important. Fortunately I could use a different approach to regain my old password.","solutions":["Hi douglas1879, I am an independent advisor and a Microsoft user like you, and I would be happy to help you out with this.Are you receiving an error message when you try to click on the links?
