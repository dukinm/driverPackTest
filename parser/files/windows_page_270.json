This will allow you to reinstall your OS, not recover\/restore it to OEM factory defaults. You would generally contact your computer maker for such media or to find out what process needs to be run to burn a recovery disk from your computer. This process varies from model to model.If you want to make Windows 10 installation media, that is what Microsoft provides via the Media Creation Tool.All you have to do is click on accept the agreement and choose the option to make an ISO file, not reinstall Windows 10. The Media Creation tool still allows you to save an ISO file that you can use to burn to a DVD or use USB flash drive.However, the size of the Windows 10 install has been steadily increasing. If the ISO file is greater than the size of your burnable media, a larger capacity media will be required. This requirement is satisfied by purchasing dual-layer DVDRs or resorting to purchasing a USB flash drive.
