Yesterday I tried to connect my bluetooth headphones to my computer like I normally would but, after pressing the bluetooth icon in notification center, the bluetooth icon disappeared. I looked it up on device manager, and I didn't find bluetooth there unless I clicked \"show hidden devices\". Now I can't find the bluetooth in hidden devices anymore. I can't enable bluetooth in settings, there is no bluetooth on switch anymore.\u00a0Also I in device manager I have one device in USB devices which has yellow warning sign and says: Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed), error code is 43. I have nothing connected to the USB-ports so I think this can be related for my Bluetooth issue. I have found that some people had their Bluetooth hidden from device manager and had this issue too.I have searched this particular issue on web and I have found some threads and I tried all the following things to restore my Bluetooth:- I ran troubleshooting for Bluetooth, it just said that I dont have bluetooth enabled, I can try to enable it with external adapter.- I ran troubleshooting for Hardware and devices and it did show the \"Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)\" issue, but didn't fix it.- Also, I tried to troubleshooters for network adapters and windows update but they didn't find any issues.- I've tried SFC \/scannow and DISM.exe but they didn't find any issues.- I have just updated newest Windows version, and I have tried install windows again, but the issue still persists.- I have tried to uninstall \"Unknown USB Device (Device Descriptor Request Failed)\" and also uninstall my main usb driver, but that didn't fix it.- I installed correct Bluetooth and network adapters from Intel's site and I also tried to delete them from installer and install again, but that didn't fix it too.\u00a0-\u00a0 I Installed also Intel's driver updater but that didn't solve my issue.

That's 90, which is the maximum recommended elsewhere plus 3 to make sure it is over 90!4) Press the power key briefly to start your computer5) Allow it to start fully. If you open Device Manager (e.g. right click Windows Key -> Device Manager or from the Control Panel), you should now see that the Bluetooth section has reappeared and there are no Unknown USB devices in the USB section. This means that your Bluetooth is now working again.This apparently works by disconnecting the power (even residual power) from relevant chips which mean that they re-establish communications from scratch when you restart."]},{"symptom":"Network Spped Test        To download network speed test, is Microsoft store only Option.

Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough.

However, after the update completed and the PC attempted a restart, I get an error that a boot drive is required and it will not load Windows at all. I had a very similar issue when it forced me to update a few months ago which not was a pain to fix but my computer has not been the same since, so this is very frustrating for me.In my BIOS, it just lists my only drive which is a Crucial P1 1TB. It does not list any other boot options and it is set for that drive, but I get the error mentioned above. Last time this happened it listed my drive twice, one as MBR drive. I have since tried another drive in the system with a previously working version of Windows 10 (that was my old drive for that PC) which is also encountering the same issue (It is a Crucial 250GB MX500 2.5 inch SSD).My PC has the following hardware:Gigabyte X470 Auroras motherboardRyzen 7 2700X32GB of Ballistic Tactical DDR4 RAM rated at 3000MT\/s (4 modules with 8GB each, same exact model)1TB Crucial P1 NVMe SSDXFX 8GB RX580When this first happened, it took a lot of time and effort to get it working again, but at first it would only run the memory at 2400MT\/s which previously it worked at the rated 3000MT\/s without any issue. It would also often restart before even getting to the BIOS several times without any noticeable pattern; sometimes it did within a few seconds, sometimes within a few minutes, but always would not get to the BIOS the first few (or more) times.I replaced the PSU with a better one at that time, but the issue persisted. I also used Memtest 86 which did not find any problems with the memory (I though that the system only running the memory at 2400MT\/s despite the profile having it at 3000MT\/s may show signs that the issue stemmed from the RAM, but I was wrong).After clocking my memory down to 2933 I was able to boot into Windows, but it would often BSOD and ran the memory at 2400 instead of 2933. So I reverted Windows back to a previous version and it partially fixed the issue. It would still restart a few times before getting to the BIOS, but would be able to boot to Windows 10 and run the memory at 2933 without BSOD.I did not turn off or had any loss in power during the update; I allowed the update to be uninterrupted and it took about an hour for this last one.I really need help with this one as this has become a very frustrating issue for me.","solutions":["Hi CD. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function. If any steps won't work then report back and move on to the next. At least one step will always work, leading up to if necessary doing an automated Reset or a gold standard Clean Install: 1) Try whichever method works in this tutorial link to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore or Uninstall Updates button, or if this is a version update Go Back to Old Version:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2294-advanc.... Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times to force it into Repair Mode.If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.2) If necessary borrow another PC and follow the steps in the middle of this download page to create bootable installation media to access the repair options if not accessible by any other method:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m.... The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https:\/\/www.sysnative.com\/forums\/hardware-tutor... You may need to enter BIOS\/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:https:\/\/www.mydigitallife.net\/comprehensive-lis... Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link.3) Choose Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore, or if this was a version Update choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version.If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/224471\/how-to-prevent... There is a new option after Version 1809 to roll back Windows Updates from the Repair Mode in Option Four here:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/5486-uninst... If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows.4) If that fails you can use the booted media created in Step 2 to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.The media provided for the Clean Install is latest and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:https:\/\/tb.rg-adguard.net\/public.phpBurn to DVD or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/detail...

Two were the USB drive I created (both identical) two were the Crucial 1TB P1 (also identical) and another the was completely empty, as in it was a selectable option, but that option had no letters numbers or characters to speak of. Those only seem to come up when there is a USB drive connected to the PC.For curiosity, I clicked on the option with nothing in it and now the update is continuing from 30%. I find this strange, but this sort of happened last time. I am not considering this resolved until I can boot normally into Windows, not experience any BSOD and be able to run my memory at the speed it is rated for.From what it seems like to me is that Windows required a restart in the middle of the update and then did something to my BIOS where it no longer able to boot correctly, let alone to continue the update.I will respond when more happens.","Shortly after my last response, my display is left showing a black screen with nothing but a single blinking underscore at the top left corner. There is no text or anything else but the blinking underscore. How long should I leave it before forcing a shutdown?","I would shutdown and then follow the steps I gave to boot into the media to do the repairs suggested.Were you referring earlier to the Boot Menu that was triggered when you tried to boot into the installation media you created? It sounds like you might have chosen the System partition which tried to start Windows and was continuiing the Update installation.I'm not sure what the double listings are about but I'd reset the BIOS to default. Is it Legacy or UEFI? Do you happen to know if the 1tb has a UEFI install? If not and it's a UEFI install you may need to enable CSM or Legacy BIOS as this can sometimes change with the install of a newer AHCI SATA driver. To reset BIOS: https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/reset-pc-bios-...https:\/\/www.maketecheasier.com\/how-to-reset-cmo...","I was indeed referring to the boot menu. Storage Boot Option Control is in Legacy and Other PCI Device ROM Priority is in UEFI Only. I am not sure if my 1TB has a UEFI install.I performed a CMOS reset the last time this happened, but it did not resolve the issue. I will give it another go and should that not work, I will proceed with the steps to recover from a failed update.","It would be Storage Boot Option control (i.e. Storage = Hard drive\/SSD) so try setting it to UEFI to see if it boots. If not you may have a Legacy install on a UEFI system which is like disabling all of the safety features in a brand new car. So if it won't start in UEFI, Legacy or CSM\/Compatibility (either) then I'd wipe the drive and reinstall in UEFI mode, booting the media as a UEFI Device.Follow the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using these methods:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Keep me posted on your progress as I will be here to help until the case is resolved.","I appreciate you sticking with me. Before I switch from Legacy to UEFI, I performed a CMOS reset, which gave me some interesting results afterward when attempting to boot to the drive. I have attached a picture because I cannot find words to describe what it displayed:https:\/\/postimg.cc\/9zjXSLx2Every subsequent boot has different results, but in a similar fashion. I am thankfully able to boot to the BIOS still, which was a concern of mine after seeing this.","Switching to UEFI Only yields the same result. Attempting clean install as suggested.","Yeah that's weird. Make sure to set UEFI, Secure and Fast boot enabled (the last two can wait until after install if they interfere).Windows Boot Manager will invoke itself after you wipe the partitions off the drive during Custom Install by deleting them down to Unallocated Space, then click Next to let it auto-create the necessary partitions and auto-format them GPT - this makes it foolproof.WBM must remain set first to boot at all times thereafter.","Should I be concerned about recovering my Windows key for installation?
