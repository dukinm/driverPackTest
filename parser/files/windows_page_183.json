If I click on \"Network\", it brings up an Explorer window with a list of all devices found on my local network (NAS, TV, printers, etc.). If I right-click and choose Refresh, this list will refresh. If I then open up \"This PC\", it brings up an Explorer window with the hard drives, etc. on my local PC. Included in this list is my NAS, which is not a mountable drive, but a separate host altogether.After I load the \"This PC\" Explorer window, any subsequent attempt to open or refresh the \"Network\" Explorer window will hang indefinitely (at least 24 hours). This only happens after opening \"This PC\", never before. It is 100% reproducible. The \"This PC\" and other Explorer windows will continue to function just fine, as long as they do not display anything from the \"Network\" hierarchy (for example, in the sidebar). The only recourse to the unresponsive window is to kill and restart explorer.exe in the Task Manager.Any ideas what is causing this? Rebooting the computer does not fix the issue -- the behavior happens after reboots. Disks are not corrupt -- disk scans do not find any problems, and it works 100% of the time before opening \"This PC\".","solutions":["Hi Hrunting. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.1) First let's try some of the fixes working recently for Explorer issues reported here. I'll include crashes as well as hangs as they seem to be related with most of these, and can be caused by Updates:https:\/\/www.easeus.com\/resource\/how-to-fix-wind...https:\/\/www.bing.com\/videos\/search?q=windows+10...https:\/\/www.kapilarya.com\/fix-file-explorer-not...https:\/\/superuser.com\/questions\/1274763\/windows...https:\/\/www.theinquirer.net\/inquirer\/news\/30842...https:\/\/community.spiceworks.com\/topic\/2191691-...2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.4) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... -------------------------------------------- But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/265054\/how-to-easily-... I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.
