I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.1) Compare the install you did with this gold standard Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link has ever come back to report problems that I have seen. It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

Talk about the new Windows 11 update is out there and it's doubtful that Microsoft would deny a this new update due to the fact that, if they were to, they would lose a lot of customers over time. Surprisingly, they have said that there won't ever be a \"Windows 11\" either, which goes to tell that we don't know how open Microsoft is to the possibility in the future.As said in the past by Steve Kleynhans, \u201cEvery three years or so Microsoft would sit down and create \u2018the next great OS\u2019.\u201d Since Windows 10 was released July 29th of 2015, it would be expected that they come up with something new in the summer of 2018. But why haven't they? Instead they have come out with updates when the public may not be feeling the same about the\u00a0 OS that has been out for so long. If you really think about it, there might be reason to believe that there may be another OS coming, emphasis on may, because it may or may not apply and we do not want to make assumptions.Briefly describing, Apple previously had a really hard time picking up when Steve Jobs was removed from his own business. They lost a lot of customers and Microsoft had their great chance to grow in popularity, and they did. However, this was quickly reversed when Mr. Jobs was rehired. He made a lot of changes that made many workers of the company very upset, but his gamble was a great play.He completely redesigned the company and hired people through very strict, necessary processes. After doing this Apple finally released it's next product and boomed with business. Microsoft even had a little bit of a hard time, since Apple, their great opponent in the market, had just stole a lot of their customers. Now, let's take a step back for a moment and look at how each company uses their own strategy to keep their money going. Not to point the obvious, but both companies use very different strategies, and have their own reason for success. Probably the only thing they have in common as far as market strategy goes is the fact that they both use broad differentiation, which is something just about every company uses.First let's take a look at Microsoft. Microsoft's primary strategy is market penetration. Market penetration is used by selling more products to customers to keep them coming. This is a powerful, and often effective, way to keep a business in the market. It's an intensive strategy that ensures Microsoft\u2019s growth through aggressive sales and marketing.Apple has a very different primary strategy. They use product development to keep their products looking very desirable, attracting customers like miners to gold. Apple has done a very good job with this too. However, the way they do this has a very large fault. With every new iDevice that comes out, it carries the same OS as the last, with only minor updates with subtle differences in the themes. Now, they did great with their new iPhone X, but many customers said that they would actually prefer the iPhone 8 over the iPhone X. This hints that Apple might be losing their grip on the community.With this all being said, let's come back to our point and use the information to further agree that Windows will need a new update to keep in business. Seeing how Apple is losing their grip, Microsoft is definitely going to want to take advantage of that. They can use the opportunity to create something brand new that the community has yet to see and draw in a lot of customers from Apple. Now this would be very difficult to do before this next summer hits because that is a lot of work on the part of Microsoft employees to come up with a whole new design to sparkle at their customers. But is it?You see, Microsoft actually doesn't have to worry about that at all. They won't have to lift a finger in part of coming up with a new design because their customers want that new Windows 11 update so bad they have already made tons of these designs, and all Microsoft has to do is pick one that the community likes and get to work. With that being accounted for, Microsoft could definitely have a new update for 2019. And they would make make consumers very happy.","solutions":["There will be no Windows 11. With Windows 10, Windows became a\u00a0service and instead of a new standalone version, Microsoft is pushing bi-annual feature updates for Windows 10 every 6 months. In future, feature updates will be remain and forever and maybe Windows 10 will be renamed to \"Windows\". https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/deployment\/update\/waas-overviewCurrent latest Windows 10 version\/feature update is version 1809 (aka October 2018 Update). Next Windows 10 version coming in spring 2019 is 1903 (codenamed 19H1, official name hasn't been announced, likely will be April 2019 Update).Windows 10 version history:\u00a0https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Windows_10_version_history","While I understand there may be no Windows 11, I also understand that Microsoft will have to go about doing the same thing that Apple has done with their products, as I had mentioned previously in the article. Given their other products lose sales, they would want to rely on bringing these new features to Windows 10. Now I do not say this as a certain statement, but out of my own views. Microsoft has done a great job bringing out plenty of products to the community, and undoubtedly better than almost any other company. However, the problem poses when people tire of Windows 10 and tire of receiving all of these new features. The new features would take much storage from a device with each that comes out, and eventually, assuming they continue to do this, they are going to come to a point when they will want a whole new Windows version because of the inability to find new features that aren't deemed, for lack of a better word, stupid by the community.If you take a look closer, Microsoft revolves around their Windows 10. That is what defines Microsoft as a company, is it's unique operating system that is unlike any other. Coming out with these new features is great while it lasts, but, like I said before, eventually that comes to a point of disability. So, looking at our options versus creating a Windows 11, probably the best alternative would be coming out with a product that replaces Windows 10. If they were to do this, then it would actually be fairly hard to sell this product to people below the higher end of middle class. Because of the research and development that would be needed, this item would be extremely expensive. Especially if it is going to satisfy customers for what they could no longer find in Windows 10.Keeping Windows 10 will also have the possibility of becoming very retro. When you continue to have one name brand with a few features coming out on a 2 year term per update, it starts to become as I had mention before. However, if you were to have, say the New Windows 11, customers could get excited over the possibility of a whole, brand new look on their software. With this, Microsoft could even begin to launch various series of updates, supporting different products. They could program unique software for multi-monitor systems that could be added on to their fancy new Windows OS. They could develop exotic hardware for the use on enhancing the user's use of the product they own. They could design multiple interfaces, so that each user has a choice on which feel they like best.\u00a0If they were to do this, they could majorly increase in sales. If you have multiple lines of products, each of which with its own unique property designed for further aiding and\/or improving the way a product is used, then people are going to want to go and buy these new products. It sure seems a lot more profitable than coming out with bi-annual updates for a set program that will never recieve an update for its own self. Even if you could do this with what will be called \"Windows\" instead of \"Windows 10\", the ability to have a variety in your selection as to what you are going to use just beats that single style.As I first said, I understand that Microsoft has said there will be no Windows 11.
