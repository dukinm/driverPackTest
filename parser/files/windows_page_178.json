This is a useful feature, but it can cause your PC to become stuck at the Welcome screen.To fix the issue, you need to enter Safe Mode and disable Fast Startup feature. To enter Safe Mode, follow the steps from the previous solution. Once you enter Safe Mode, you need to do the following:Press Windows Key + S and enter control panel.

an access denied error, so sound currently on the PC.\u00a0 Added permissions to the registry key for the service.\u00a0 Changed the service login account from Local Service to Local System.\u00a0 That allowed the audio service to start but it didn't fix the problem.\u00a0In other respects, Windows is working properly.\u00a0 What can I do to fix these problems?","solutions":["I had to do a clean install of windows 10, which fixed the problem.I believe what happened was that key system accounts were corrupted by a corruption of the drive the operating system was installed on.\u00a0 For whatever reason, the corruption of these accounts manifested in two areas that were visible to me (the Windows Audio service not being able to start because the Local Service account was corrupted and the Windows search box being locked).\u00a0 Probably over time other symptoms would also have appeared.I believe the reason the drive windows 10 was installed on got corrupted was that it was coexisting on the same machine with another drive that still hosted Windows 7, and the machine was not set up in a dual-boot configuration.\u00a0\u00a0In anticipation of the end of support for Windows 7 on January 14, I decided to migrate the machine to Windows 10 in a way that would allow me to continue to use the Windows 7 installation until I got everything configured the way I needed it on the Windows 10.\u00a0 I anticipated the period of overlap when both operating systems would coexist on the machine to be about a week.\u00a0 So I purchased a new solid-state drive SSD, installed it on the PC, disconnected the original hard drive (hosting Windows 7), and installed Windows 10 on the new SSD using a DVD created using the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool.\u00a0 After the Windows 10 installation completed, I reconnected the original hard drive.I opted against a traditional dual-boot configuration, because I had read that such a configuration would require me to keep the original hard drive in order for Windows 10 to boot, since the boot loader for both operating systems would be located on the original hard drive.\u00a0 My plan was to re-partition and reformat the original hard drive after the migration to Windows 10 was complete, so I didn't want the new operating system to have any dependencies to that drive after the period of overlap had ended.\u00a0 I didn't mind going into the BIOS to switch the boot order every time I needed to switch operating systems for the week that I expected the two operating systems to coexist on the machine.(See https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/windows_10-hardware\/how-do-i-set-my-new-ssd-as-the-only-bootsystem\/5fb0725d-1117-4623-aba4-96a72c4a6b12?auth=1).After the upgrade, the original hard drive was assigned the drive letter C: in Windows 7 as it always was and the new SSD was assigned the drive letter E:\u00a0 When I booted to Windows 10, by contrast, the new SSD was assigned the drive letter C: and the original hard drive was assigned the drive letter F:Initially everything was fine.\u00a0 But after several switches between the two operating systems, I began to get messages on boot-up saying that inconsistencies had been detected and CHKDSK needed to run in order to fix them.\u00a0 When I booted to Windows 10 (installed on the SSD), it automatically ran CHKDSK to fix inconsistencies on the original hard drive (that hosted Windows 7).\u00a0 When I booted to Windows 7, it automatically ran CHKDSK to fix problems on the new SSD (where Windows 10 was installed).These \"fixes\" actually turned out to be very damaging.\u00a0 Though the Windows 7 installation on the original hard drive did not appear to be affected by the action of the Windows 10 CHKDSK, the Windows 10 installation on the new SSD apparently was affected in an adverse manner by the action of the Windows 7 CHKDSK.\u00a0 I believe it was this corruption of the Windows 10 drive that caused the security accounts inside Windows 10 to be corrupted, which in turn led to the symptoms of the search box lockup and Windows Audio service being unable to boot.Once I realized what had probably happened, I abandoned all hopes of trying to fix the problem and opted instead for clean install of Windows 10.\u00a0 Since I had documented all the configuration steps I had taken, I was confident that I would have no further need for the Windows 7 installation.\u00a0 So before beginning the windows 10 clean install, I went into the BIOS and removed the original hard drive from the boot sequence altogether.\u00a0 As part of the Windows 10 reinstall, I re-partitioned and reformatted the SSD to make sure the new installation was built on a solid foundation.\u00a0 The first time I rebooted into Windows 10, it noticed some errors on the original hard drive and ran CHKDSK to fix them.\u00a0 It hardly matters, since that drive will no longer be used in its current format, but will be re-partitioned and reformatted from within Windows 10.\u00a0 The new installation has been up and running now for a number of days and everything seems to be working fine.Apparently, Windows 7 CHKDSK is capable of producing unwanted side-effects when it is run on a drive hosting Windows 10 (though Windows 10 CHKDSK appears to be benign with respect to a Windows 7 installation)."]},{"symptom":"2 Microsoft accounts  on same La[p top        I got my new HP Laptop\u00a0But had trouble signing in My Microsoft account\u00a0Tried several times but could not\u00a0So

However, I later realized that those files are still on the iPod.When I open iTunes, the files are displayed as \"Other\" instead of as audio and video files as they were before and iTunes can't read the files. Also, when I eject the iPod from my laptop, no audio or video files are shown on the device.However, the music and video files play just fine with the Groove Music app. Despite that, I can't seem to find the location of the files on the iPod through \"Computer\" when it's plugged into my laptop.\u00a0Since Windows screwed up the files, surely there's some way to use Windows to make the files readable as audio and video files again, correct?","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Windows will not go to sleep (I've tried everything)        Headline:\u00a0 my windows 10 PC will not automatically go to sleep based on the sleep timers for either \"Screen\" or \"Sleep.\"\u00a0 It will try (screen goes black for a second) but then goes bask to my desktop.\u00a0 If I manually click the start icon and go to power\/sleep, the computer will go to sleep.\u00a0 However it will wake itself up randomly to the login screen.I'm hoping there is someone who can help read a log file to determine if there is anything in there that is causing this issue.\u00a0 I suspect it may be hardware related as I seem to have exhausted every software related fix.Things I have tried:Powercfg -requests shows nothing (because it actually doesn't go to sleep, it just tries, but never makes it)Powercfg -lastawake shows nothingPowercfg \/waketimers will just show updateorchestrator\u00a0I have disabled my ethernet device from waking up the computer including magic packetI have disabled my wireless mouse and wireless keyboard from waking up the computerI have turned off the windows updateorchestrator to wake the computerI've tried turning hybrid sleep on and offI spit out a log from powercfg and all of the items said \"this will not prevent your computer from sleeping\"Probably several other that I can't rememberAny experts out there?","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Forza Horizon Pc doesnt recognize Lego Speed Champions        I just bought the expansion for my husband, and he aint find a way\u00a0 to play it ingame.
