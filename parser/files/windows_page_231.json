If you interrupt it a couple of times before it fully loads it will eventually offer you the recovery options. Just press and hold in the button until it goes off, and repeat 2 or 3 times (doing this while it's still loading before it gets to the picture screen is best).Once you can access the recovery options System Restore (under Troubleshooting) might be the best place to start... this can unwind a config issue to solve the problem.Regards, David"]},{"symptom":"Something is taking up RAM?

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.So your Reset failed? This is fairly common with corrupted installs since it relies on files already onboard.You may need to create bootable media to Reset or do the gold standard Clean install. The bootable media has it's own drivers, repair and installation files which often work when Windows or the other Repair Mode doesn't.To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m.... Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only.Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https:\/\/www.sysnative.com\/forums\/hardware-tutor... If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS\/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then System Restore and Uninstall Updates. If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands. If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to try to rescue your files using these methods:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... I hope this helps.

In msconfig > Services it should show you the manufacturer.But almost none of these are needed except you Antivirus and Sync, so it's usually OK to disable the others.
