It had Windows 10 installed on it, but it had a password so I thought I'd just reinstall a fresh copy of Windows anyway and it'd re-activate itself, but I was wrong. The computer was a custom home built with \"after market\" parts so it isn't OEM. I installed Pro x64 but I'm just curious now if HOME or a different version would have been able to activate? Or if there is any product ID info on the hardware that Microsoft would have on file or if there is anything to do at this point. Technically it isn't a big deal as the computer still works un-activated, but if it was something easy it'd obviously be better activated. The only other thing that I'm thinking is if the computer's digital activation is linked to the previous person's Microsoft login and if so would I need to be logged in on their Microsoft account to get it to activate?","solutions":["Hi AcquiredBurrito! I am an independent advisor and a Microsoft user like you, and I would be happy to help you out with this.There are 2 ways to activate Windows 10: 1. Using a product key which is typically how it has been done, and 2. Using a digital license, which is typically associated with a Microsoft account. (and in your case, possibly the previous person's Microsoft login)If possible, I would suggest to see if your relative has the product key and information on which version of Windows 10 was installed.The license does have to match the version of Windows installed, so for example, it is possible that it was previously Windows 10 Home, and so that product key would not activate the Pro version you have installed. You would have to install Windows 10 Home and re-activate with the product key. For more information on Windows 10 activation, please visit: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/help\/12440\/...

I wasn't planning on installing apps on my new pc.\u00a0 I actually bought the wrong laptop and found out afterward info on the OS, and saw that it is a comparable to a Chromebook,. My understanding of a Chromebook is that it is used mainly for browsing the internet and playing games (basically for installing apps, not software). I really needed the pc for my work, which mainly is working with images and word processing, some audio and video editing, etc...So I decided I needed to see about exchanging it for a different pc, then realized the the one I bought had more memory and storage...that's when I started trying to find out if I can use the software I need to use on the recently purchased pc..I want to upgrade to probably Windows 10 Pro, but for sure Windows 10 Home...I just wanted to make sure I can install software on the version without the s mode...for now...thank you very much for your input:)","Thank you for your response, I am aware that it only installs the MS apps...I wanted to be sure that the new pc with windows 10 s mode would run software after turning it off....Thanks again","My pleasure! Happy to help."]},{"symptom":"Couldn't find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint        Hi thereMy fingerprint scanner on my HP Envy stopped working a few days ago.\u00a0 I receive an error message when viewing the sign in options \"Couldn't find a fingerprint scanner compatible with Windows Hello Fingerprint\".I've checked Device Manager to ensure that it is set to Automatic and running.\u00a0\u00a0","solutions":["Hi Tina, I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 3 year Windows Insider MVP here to help.A reinstall of HP Simplepass or the fingerprint driver would likely solve the issue.Please go to the following page and select your model. https:\/\/support.hp.com\/in-en\/driversDownload Validity Fingerprint Sensor driver or HP SimplePass application under Keyboard, Mouse and Input devices.Open the setup and follow the instructions.
