{"windows":[{"symptom":"Can't preview jpg files in the preview pane -- Windows 10 Fall Update (1709)        Split from this thread.I have this issue and it started with the Windows 10 Fall update (1709).\u00a0 jpg files are not displayed in the preview pane but other files are displayed (pdf, docx, xlxs, etc.).\u00a0 I've tried setting the default jpg program to several different programs to no avail.\u00a0 Prior to the 1709 update, jpg files were displayed in the File Explorer preview pane.\u00a0 It seems to be an issue with the 1709 update.","solutions":["Noticed the same problem since 1709. The option to show icons is NOT checked and never has been, although I look there every few days just in case. The preview pane is empty white for most JPEGs, but not all. No discernable difference in the files. What's more, since 1709, most JPEGs don't even show their thumbnails, just a generic white-and-blue icon. Again, not every JPEG, but most. To make the thumbnails appear, I have to open a photo by double-clicking (opens in Photos). But even then the thumbnail only survives a while. It's back to generic icons tomorrow.\u00a0 Initially I blamed it on my user account, so I went through the laborious process of starting with a new user account, but the problem remains.\u00a0","Check which application is associated with JPG files. Right click on a JPG file, select \"open with\" menu option, then \"Choose Another App\" from the child menu which appears.\u00a0Ensure you are using the \"Photos\" application.\u00a0I suspect you have installed another graphics package such as paint.net and it has taken over the file assocation.Problem is that Explorer need to get that application to render the image for display in the preview window, and if it cannot do so the preview window will remain blank.","My problem is not related to file association, I've tried changing file association to multiple programs, including MS Paint.\u00a0 To clarify, my problem is with jpg files not displaying in the File Explorer preview pane and has nothing to do with file icons.I've discovered the problem is related to the new 1709 update feature \"OneDrive Files On-Demand\".\u00a0 The problem with jpg files not displaying in the File Explorer preview pane only occurs for files that are on OneDrive with \"Files On-Demand\" enabled.\u00a0 I have some files & folders specified as \"Always Keep on this device\" and I expect files to be displayed in preview -- and they are except for jpg files.\u00a0 Other file types (pdf, txt, docx, xlsx, etc.) preview without issue.\u00a0 jpg files on disk only and not on OneDrive ARE displayed in preview, the problem is only for jpg files on OneDrive, even though \"Always keep on this device\" is enabled.If \"Files On-Demand\" is enabled and \"Always keep on this device\" is not enabled (files are in the cloud only) then no files are previewed (makes sense).I have another computer that was just updated to 1709.\u00a0 The \"Files on demand\" feature has not been enabled so all OneDrive files are on disk.\u00a0 It displays jpg files on OneDrive in preview without issue.To summarize my problem as I see it...\u00a0 jpg files on OneDrive are not displayed in File Explorer preview if and only if \"Files On-Demand\" is enabled, even though those files are kept on disk.","Interesting!\u00a0When I posted yesterday, I believed the selection of Photos as the application to view had solved my issue.\u00a0I subsequently found it had for a number of files - around 40%.I don't use OneDrive, and these were all fresh pictures I had just taken on iPhone and copied to PC.Another thread suggested changing file ending from uppercase JPG to lowercase jpg; and after I did this I was able to preview all images.What a muddle!\u00a0","I had this same problem in Windows 7, and after scouring the internet for hours (days) and pulling my hair out, finally noticed that it was only .JPG files in all CAPS, not lowercase.So I guess something changed in a Windows 7 update as well as Windows 10 (and I assume others?), because I have never seen this problem before and some of these JPGs haven't changed since the 90s.","I have the same problem.\u00a0 I am a photographer so it slows me down.","Hi,Have you checked if you have the latest update for your Windows 10? Have you also encountered this after installing Fall Creators Update?What are the troubleshooting steps you've already done? If nothing yet, let's run the following scans to repair missing or corrupted system files:System File CheckerThe System File Checker or SFC is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore these corrupted files.DISM or System Update Readiness toolThe DISM or Deployment Image Servicing and Management can help you fix some Windows corruption errors as well.We'll be waiting for your response.Regards.","I've had this problem on all my computers.\u00a0 It only happens on JPGs in OneDrive.\u00a0 If they're on the computer, but not in OneDrive, they preview as they should.\u00a0 Eventually, they started working in OneDrive on all 4 of my devices.\u00a0 This device, I had to reset and since then, it reverted back to not showing previews of JPGs in OneDrive. I've unclicked \"save space and download files as I need them\" which seemed to work the last time, so I'll see if it works again this time or if something else made that happen, that I wasn't aware of.","Finally found the solution.Now that Windows 10 has nearly removed the old Control Panel; several items which are only available via the Control Panel are harder to find.Open the old Control Panel; type into the Win10 Search Field \"Control Panel\" and then click the result to Open it. Make sure the Categories option is set; then click on Appearance and Personalisation; then File Explorer Options.A new window will open -- click on the View tab.The first choice \"UNCHECK\" Always show icons, never thumbnails.- - - - - - - - - -I have now also found this same setting in the View Menu of Windows 10 File Explorer. At the far right-side of the header ribbon after clicking on the View Tab is an icon labelled Options.Clicking this -- select the first choice \"Change Folder and Search Options. A new window opens. Click on the View Tab; then again UNCHECK the first choice \"Always show icons, never thumbnails.\"","There is an easy solution for this. Copy (not cut) the images without preview and paste them back in the same folder. Now you will get the preview and can delete the originals."]},{"symptom":"Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 - November 2019 (KB890830) -Error 0x800711c7        keep getting this message on windows update even after clicking retry several times,There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later.Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool x64 - November 2019 (KB890830) -Error 0x800711c7","solutions":["Hello!

Only reason I usually even need to reboot my computer, ever, is because OneDrive starts this infinite loop of \"can't connect to windows\" and then parades around victoriously when I reboot and it's like \"Wow we've connected to Windows again, how amazing!\".(like, why is this a thing? Why does it run a victory lap when rebooting is required to fix it? Windows architecture provides all the mechanisms that OneDrive would need to reset and restart any malfunctioning service and fix it without rebooting, but it thinks this is a \"success\", by me, the user, doing something that isn't even offered by the obnoxious error dialog? It doesn't offer a reboot option... just \"try again\" and \"kill everything\")Worst part about this is the dialog box - offering a confusing message (you ARE Windows, you come with Windows, how are you unable to connect to yourself?), and offering only a very destructive non-option as the way forward (I absolutely can not and will not download my full OneDrive to my machine!). No way to simply \"exit\".I already tried completely sanitizing OneDrive, all its configuration, all its registry entries, all its config files and any lingering detritus from my system, then reinstalling completely clean, and after finally getting Setup to cooperate, I'm still getting this error with the same frequency. (though at least it finally seems to have stopped re-downloading new copies of itself, that might be because I killed the OneDrive update task in Task Scheduler!)I think this software has become too complex for anyone at Microsoft to actually fix.edit: let's keep track of when this occurs, shall we?\"first\" time (probably the 5th actually) was when I posted this, 11\/30\/19.Now it just did it again, 12\/2\/19.

I haven't forgotten about this thread, but here it is 1\/2\/2020 and it hasn't happened since. Nice! But my OneDrive hasn't been updating - still version 19.192.0926.0012 last modified 11\/25\/2019. Maybe a Windows update did it...? Hmm.update: HA. HA. It's back. 1\/7\/2020. Of course I had to jinx it. I'll bet you anything, it's related to network connectivity issues, some inability to load a network resource while OneDrive is being asked for something from an app or process somewhere.","Same problem here...\u00a0The problem occurs every two weeks or so...rebooting always helps, but that's very annoying.","same problem","I see that the reboot is not quickin practice with the reboot the kernel is reset ...

Thank you.***Post moved by the moderator to the appropriate forum category.***","solutions":["Along with many others, I have been fighting this vexing problem. Here's what finally did the trick for me, based on piecing tips together from others.1) EXHAUSTIVELY search all your e-mail folders - ALL OF THEM, TRASH, SPAM, INBOX, ARCHIVES,everything - for e-mails that contain the bad address.\u00a0 Remember that if the bad address was one of several in a message, even if it bounced the address is still part of that message. And it might be in a reply that was sent to you.2) Delete EVERY LAST ONE of the messages with the bad address. The ENTIRE message. If it's something you really need to keep, copy-and-paste the contents into a NEW message and send it to yourself. DO NOT JUST FORWARD THE MESSAGE to yourself or elsewhere - the bad address will still get dragged along with it. Make sure you do not copy headers - body text ONLY.3) Double- and triple-check what you did in steps 1 & 2 so you're not wasting time because you missed one.4) Log in to outlook.live.com and delete all of your contacts there. I am not sure this step is really necessary, but it was included in one of the other sources I used and it's not going to hurt to do it even if it's not necessary.5) On Windows, do Settings|Apps|Mail|Advanced Options|Reset.\u00a06) On Windows, do Settings|Apps|People|Advanced Options|Reset.7) Restart your computer.After doing all this, I found that the bad e-mail address was GONE. So were a number of others, which I presume had been in my e-mail folders at some time but which had no traces left by this time (i.e., a bad address in one or two messages that had long since been permanently deleted.)It appears that Windows Mail is populating the Auto-Complete cache using ALL e-mail addresses that are present in ALL of your messages in ALL of your folders. So if you eliminate every possible trace of it and reset the Mail app, it has to rebuild the Auto-Complete cache and doesn't have any instances of the bad address to pull in."]},{"symptom":"Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library error message        When I open the program FiveM it updates than I got this messageMicrosoft Visual C++ Runtime Library assertion failedline:103expression: res <=1I dont know what to do please reply as soon as you can I appreciate it","solutions":["Hi and thanks for reaching out!
