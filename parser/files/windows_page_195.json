Before I did this, I was able to change the install location of apps on Microsoft store and have NVIDIA Control Panel. Although I fixed the mic issues I had, now I can't change the install location nor download NVIDIA Control Panel. Might I add, I kinda need NVIDIA Control Panel in order for GeForce Experience to work. I've been at this for a week now, and I have tried many methods, such as Change permissions on files (When changing on C drive, access is denied), take control over command prompt, and even adding a take ownership command on Registry Editor. I just want my computer to work, and I'm sick and tired of being forced to install apps on a drive that literally has no space for more.

The reason I suggest this is that no one who has adopted the install in the above link has ever come back to report further problems I've seen, including another version failure.
