Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check\/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter. Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates. Select Windows Components and open Biometrics. Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature. Reboot your PC. 4) Update drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage only. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is how to keep the latest manufacturer's drivers current. Windows Update drivers are never enough.If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the version upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished. Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -> Scan for hardware changes. The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 5) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool as shown here:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta... 6) If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta....7) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 8) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.9) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... -------------------------------------------- But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues.

Of those, many have created image backup applications for consumers that are much more capable and convenient than what Windows has\/had, and some of those applications are even free.Since Windows is, and has always been, an operating system first and foremost, Microsoft may have simply said: why continue to compete in a technology that's not our focus or specialty?","Thanks.I was already trying to use a third party but I encountered a problem in trying to change the bios boot up.For some reasons when I reach the display where I could choose the repair type , I cannot move down the menu as the arrow keys do not seem to work at all.\u00a0(Neither does the CR, nor the esc).I first thought it was a keyboard problem but I used another one and get the same result.Any clues on how to get around that problem?ThanksSerge","Is this in the windows recovery environment or in the BIOS? have you tried using a wired keyboard and\/or mouse? if this is in the bios, what is the make and model of the device?","No it's in the recovery window.I have to look if I have a wired keyboard somewhere.

Am I correct in understanding that from the time you press the power button to the time your Windows login screen appears you see nothing at all on your monitor? This then is not necessarily a Windows issue, it's probably an issue with your BIOS and default graphics output driver. Do you have a 2nd monitor to try? How about a different output on your PC?
