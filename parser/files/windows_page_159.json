Here's how: Go to Start, enter Devices, select Bluetooth, select the device, select Remove device, and then try pairing again.\u2022Make sure that the Bluetooth-enabled audio device is on and discoverable. How you do this varies with devices, so check the info that came with your device or go to the manufacturer\u2019s website.\u00a0Also, ensure that these services are active, automatic and enabled. \"Bluetooth handsfree service and Bluetooth support service\".Please feel free to contact us, if you face any issues with Windows. We are happy to help!","Hi JoyI don't receive any error message because the computer can't 'see' the headphones. Therefore I can't pair them to begin with. So far, two phones, a music player and an iPad can detect the headset in their respective bluetooth settings (all by the headphones' name) but Windows fail at this.Concerning the suggestion in Control Panel: there is no 'My headset' option under Hardware and SoundConcerning the two suggestions from another topic:\u2022 The device is not paired with Windows so that's not the issue. Bluetooth is on and with newly updated drivers.\u2022 That's not possible seeing as it's a headset. As mentioned earlier, it works fine with other devices: I'm pretty sure it's functioning and discoverable. It blinks when waiting for a connection and that's where you need the not-yet-connected device so that you can tell it to pair with the headset. Windows simply doesn't see it: it can see my phone, TV, and an endless list of 'Unknown: Ready to pair' devices but not the headset.Concerning the services: They are both active, running and automatically enabled. The only thing I noticed about them was that they're both 'Automatic (Trigger Start)' in Startup Type. Does this make a difference?Also, my partner just mentioned that he's facing the same problem with Windows 10 (also a bluetooth headset, just a different brand) despite Windows working fine with other bluetooth devices (and likewise, his headset pairs with everything else). There must be something about headsets that Windows 10 can't figure out.","I still haven't got an answer for my last reply, and I haven't been able to figure it out on my own.The issue is still Windows 10 not being able to find the headphones, thus making it impossible to pair them in the first place. Windows detects and pairs with other Bluetooth devices, and the headphones can connect to phones without any problems.","Hello,Thank you for keeping us posted.I really appreciate all your efforts in trying to fix this issue.There might be a possibility that this issue might have occurred due to various reasons. For exampleIncorrect Bluetooth settings.Some third party program or application conflict.The Bluetooth drivers might have gone corrupt.I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works.Method 1:To diagnose the problem with the hardware, we need to run the hardware troubleshooter and check.Run inbuilt Hardware & Device troubleshooter and check if it works.Please follow the steps given below.Note: If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer was installed correctly.Press Windows + W keys on your keyboard to get the search option.Type Troubleshooting and clickTroubleshooting.Now click on view all option.Click on Hardware and Device and follow the prompts to run the troubleshooter.If the issue persists, follow method 2Method 2:Please refer to the article given below and check if it helps.Why isn\u2019t Windows finding my Bluetooth or other wireless device?http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-US\/windows-8\/why-isnt-windows-finding-deviceNote: Please ignore the title and follow the troubleshooting steps.Also I would suggest you to update the sound and the chipset drivers on the system and check if that helps.All the above steps holds good for Windows 10 as well.I hope this information is helpful.Please do let us know if you need any further assistance, we will be glad to assist you.Thank you.","Hi JayantI'm afraid neither of the options works.Method 1 (Hardware Troubleshooter) is dysfunctional because it keeps asking me to restart the computer to install updates. I've done this over 10 times, I'm 100% sure nothing needs an update but the troubleshooter claims otherwise and won't let me continue. It doesn't specify which driver is out of date and thus I'm stuck.Method 2 (the link) does not work. I get redirected to the Danish version of Windows and the title doesn't even match (it just goes to a page named 'Connect to a bluetooth device'. I can't access the link by hiding my IP adress and I can't find it on Google either.Can you copy paste the information or screencap them so I am able to follow the troubleshooting steps?","Hello,From the description, I suspect that the problem might be with the device compatibility on Windows 10. Suggest you to try connecting on different computer either running with Windows 10 or any other windows operation system to see if it works fine.
