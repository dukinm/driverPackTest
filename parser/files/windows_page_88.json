I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Guardian Moderator here to help you.I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority. Many problems right now are being solved by updating to the latest version so if you want to skip to that step see the Repair Install at bottom:Try moving the dongle to another USB port, e.g. if USB2 move to a USB3 port (blue inside) or vice versa. If plugged in front, try in back. If using a USB hub, remove it and try plugging in directly to port.Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the adapter's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model. Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers. If these fail Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall. If the BT driver is not there, access the View tab in Device Manager to \"Show Hidden Devices.\"Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/15290\/...

If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1909 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m....
