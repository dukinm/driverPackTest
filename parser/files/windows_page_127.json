In order to do so I need to format it to exFat. When I try to do that with my laptop it only shows 349GB as the size. I am trying to use Diskpart to determine if it is a \"read-only\" issue, or if I messed it up when I deleted the files that were on it, or if my laptop is unable to support that large of a HDD. I'm not sure. However, when I enter \"list disk\" in diskpart it shows the full capacity of the HDD (2794GB) and it shows how much is Free (1698GB). I select the disk and then enter \"list volume\" in diskpart and it shows the volume. It lists the size as 349GB the status as Healthy the File System as NTFS (which I need to format to exFat) and the type of volume as a Patition. I select the volume and enter \"detail disk\" in diskpart and it shows that it's not \"read-only\". So what gives? Will I be able to format this HDD or am I doing something wrong? Please Help!

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.The problem could be McAfee which is the worst thing you can install to Windows and the cause of many problems we see in forums. I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.After uninstalling antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.If you want the best on-demand scanner download and install Malwarebytes from https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/mwb-download\/ In it's Settings > Protection > Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits. Then on Scan tab choose Threat Scan and Run Scan. Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean.

In order to make the overlay stand out from the web page underneath - to force you to look at it - the overlay covers your screen with a 'grey fog.' It's not a virus - that's just how overlays work. It's actually part of the web page, part of the page's CSS code. The fog is called\u00a0dimming.Overlays are frequently used when a website wants you to subscribe, or a retailer wants you to join its mailing list. They can be annoying, in my opinion, because they obstruct what you are trying to read and force you to click on an artfully hidden 'X' in order to dismiss them.In the case of a bank like Chase, the overlay will typically be some type of credit card offer or other 'special deal' that they're trying to sell you. I get the same thing from CitiBank and Bank of America.You probably have some type of pop-up blocker installed, because pop-up blockers are very common. There is a pop-up blocker in Chrome's settings, or you might have a browser extension like AdBlock Plus or uOrigin, or it might be a feature of your McAfee software (which has a good reputation among the organizations that test antivirus software professionally.) Your pop-up blocker is successfully blocking the overlay, but not the grey fog covering the web page. This too is common, because there are so many ways that an overlay can be implemented, all the more to compel you to look at it.Where you go from here depends on how you are blocking pop-ups. Here's a low-hanging-fruit solution you can try: pressing the ESC key will often return the normal web page. Ultimately, the solution is for your pop-up blocker to block the grey fog together with the overlay, but that's tricky to do in practice. Websites do their best to force us to interact with the overlay, and actively fight pop-up blockers. Ad blocking extensions and Chrome itself can be customized for individual websites, so you can explore that too.(Sorry, no vain boasts of expertise from me.)"]},{"symptom":"Surface Pro4 and downloads        My Surface Pro4 was substituted with a new one.\u00a0 It prompted me to update Windows 10.
