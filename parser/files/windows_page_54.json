For whatever reason the PC would not recognize the monitor after turning it back on no matter what I tried:Unplugging and plugging back in the DP cableSwapping the DP cable for a HDMI cableplugging the HDMI cable into the motherboard display port instead of the GPU portDoing the above with a spare monitorAs a result I had to reset the system and lost the results of the Memtest run. As far as I'm aware there's no way to recover the results unless you save them after the test is finished. The entire experience was incredibly frustrating.I'll be running Memtest again overnight to try to gather a usable result and post a update tomorrow with how it goes. I also reseated the various components as well.Also: I looked into updating the firmware for the 240gb drive but the drive type apparently isnt supported by Corsair's drive utility (Corsair SSD Toolbox) however when open the drive is recognized and the firmware is indicated as up to date. I'll have to dig around a bit more to see if the drive is indeed up to date.","Sounds like Memtest had a failure. So you do need to run it again. Are you over-clocking anything? If so STOP!

This was prior to reinstalling windows. The system was very unstable and after running the windows memory diagnostic it was determined that there was a physical problem with the ram. I've swapped the ram with my old set which passed the Windows memory diagnostic. I've been running stock ram settings since.I've since completely rebuilt the sytem including re-seating the cpu. The ram was removed, Both drives, the gpu, the wireless card, and all cables from the PSU (both ends). I psychically took the motherboard out of the case to inspect for damage however was not able to find any. I was able to find two things from dismantling\/rebuilding the system.First, I'm not sure I installed the CPU cooler correctly. I noted after taking the cooler off the cpu it looked like that only about 25% - 30% of the paste had came in contact with the cpu. Furthermore, when I reattached the cpu cooler I made sure to follow AMD's instructions and noted that it took a LOT more pressure to apply than the first time.Secondly, I'm not sure if my Corsair SSD is firmly locking my SATA cable in place. In my experience the cable would make a snapping sound when secured which was absent from my build. Additionally I found while reconstructing my system that the cable looked quite loose even while leaving it alone. If the SSD is the issue I wouldn't have a problem ditching it and only using the 1tb m.2 drive as the boot drive.\u00a0I've taken pictures of both of these issues https:\/\/imgur.com\/a\/XSwHtrYCPUZ was uninstalled and I'm looking into\u00a0nvlddmkm.sys issues, Mobo Bios and Chipset drivers are up to date.","Pictures do indicate \"possible\" problems. Both the CPU cooler and SATA cable issues can cause the problems you are having. And it is even possible there is more than one problem. Best to refer to AMD's support and that of the motherboard (gigabyte).That Corsair utility would still worry me.... Check with Corsair about that. Here to help, Rob","Any luck yet? Here to help, Rob","As of now I haven't gotten a BSOD since the 7th. While I don't want to sound overly optimistic at this point it seems re-applying the Cpu cooler and ensuring the SSD Sata cable is firmly attached may have solved a* problem with the system.The issue now is that my drives are running extremely slow and I'm not sure what caused it. Both my SSD's are running noticeably slow with Crystal Disk Mark indicating write speeds anywhere from 100-200MB\/s. I ran CDM when I first built the system and both drives were running at their advertised speeds fine. I'll also mention that the speeds were fine after rebuilding the system. It was only later in the evening that the speeds dipped.I haven't gotten anywhere with determining the Corsair drive's firmware but Western Digital's drive utility has indicated that it's drive's firmware is up to date.\u00a0Before you ask, A Windows Defender full scan came back with no virus issues.In terms of\u00a0nvlddmkm.sys, I have found a few potential solutions that I have yet to try. I'll check back in when I know more.As for ICue, I updated it's firmware. If issue keep happening I'll completely uninstall it.\u00a0Another thing to keep in mind is that the deadline to return parts that have a manufacturing defect is approaching. I bought all the parts from Canada Computers which offers a 30-day exchange warranty service. I bought the parts on the 21st of December so the warranty will be in effect until the 20th of January. In the event that we can't nail down the issue before then I'll hand the parts off to them and let them find the faulty component.Thanks again for you help.","This is Rob with my other persona :Be sure the SSD has the latest firmware.Double check BIOS and chipset drivers.

I have also check temperatures of the CPU and GPU and they are well below 60 degrees at any given time. I play games on the computer but the GPU isn't being overloaded and neither is the CPU.
