Luckily the previous time I got it fixed by reinstalling the drivers via uninstalling them, rebooting my PC and updating them again. But this time this doesn't seem to help.With the newest Windows 10 Update and the newest drivers, whenever I lower the volume in an application, like in the YouTube Player in Chrome, the volume eventually picks up again to the max volume, even though the bar shows its lowered. This also happens in some of my games, where lowering the volume ingame doesn't have any effect. I already checked all the windows sound settings, configuration panel sound settings, sound devices and sound drivers. As said before, reinstalling the drivers doesn't seem to help. But when I reverted my general sound driver back to an older version, the problem was gone!My current general sound driver is the \"Realtek High Definition Audio\" version 6.0.1.8581 released on 27-nov-18. When I revert this one back to version 6.0.1.7535 released on 16-jun-15, the problem is gone. When I get back to the newest version, the problem is back.

I think there is some kind of compatibility problems with the newest Windows 10 update and my current sound drivers.With this post I would like to know if anyone else has this problem as well and if Microsoft is working on a fix for this. Or that it is just my PC and if there is a fix for it.","solutions":["Hi Dailen, I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.1903 is a very recent release and there might be bugs that are still not triaged by the team. In your case, HP might know if there is a problem with the specific model audio drivers.We generally ask people to revert back to an older driver if the newer one doesn't work which is the best course of action. So if it is working, I would suggest you to stick with an older driver as it sometimes becomes a necessity.Also, are you the new driver which supposedly doesn't work from Realtek website or HP?","Hi Sumit,I am sorry, but I am not entirely sure where the newest driver is from since its the one that has been on my PC since I bought it.But thank you for the fast reply and the advice, I will use the older driver for a while then.What I would like to know though is if there will be a guaranteed fix for this planned in the near future, so that I know if I need to keep using the older one forever or not. Or should I contact HP or Realtek about this problem?Dailen","Hi, As the laptop manufacturer customizes the Audio hardware according to the needs, it is guaranteed that Realtek drivers would cause problems. Hence, there isn't a point in contacting Realtek. Audio drivers must be supplied by the PC manufacturer, HP here.You can, however, try contacting HP regarding this issue and see if they provide any insight. But still, I would go by an older driver to prevent problems,","It would be very helpful if you could remove any online content or utilities from the problem environment.\u00a0 While online, there may be several volume controls involved in what you are hearing.\u00a0 If one is set to a certain volume, other ones may vary to try to compensate.\u00a0 But you problem may be related to Chrome and not the actual Realtek drivers.I have Beats Audio for one of my Apple Bluetooth headsets.\u00a0 Since Apple controls Beats Audio, maybe there is a conflict in that area.\u00a0 Can you uninstall the Beats Audio?\u00a0 If you do uninstall, can you get it back later?You also appear to have a Bios update from Dec. 2018, is that installed?","Greetings everyone,Last weekend I installed the newest big Windows 10 update 1903 and just like last time I updated my Windows 10 I again have problems with my sound drivers.
