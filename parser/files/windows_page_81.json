I have gone so far as to attempt to install Windows 95, Windows XP, Windows 7 and Windows 10. None of them will go all the way through. Several attempts, each taking 4 to 12 hours to go through, only to find someone stating that you need to press this key or that one, install in safe mode, yada yada yada.

Made a DVD from Microsoft for Windows 7, also bought one for Windows 10 just in case.2. Made a USB flash drive with Windows on it.3. Originally purchased PC and installed Windows XP. Upgraded with a full install disc for Windows 7 Pro. I finally found the original disc with the product key in the case. I throw away nothing. This has been running fine for several years. Many upgrades. Switched to a better video card years ago. Purchased a lot of games and upgraded software like Visual Studio and Microsoft Office. Some software has gone through multiple version upgrades. So, the system is good for all those games, and the OS for several years.4. I do not care if you do not work for Microsoft. I am angry and have a 1st Amendment right to express my frustration. I have spent several days reading posts and attempting to find out if the person writing knows what they are saying or not. This is impossible on the Internet. I read about people installing in safe mode and tried it. I do not work for Microsoft, so I did not know if it was the right thing to do or not. So, I ranted. What's your point? I am trying to deal with the excessive amount of time waiting for responses. I had to wait for 15 minutes trying to click on a box to accept the terms. It occasionally scrolled down, but then would pause and do nothing. Walked away, came back to see the box was finally checked. So, I pressed the NEXT button and had to wait yet again. This happens in every version of Windows I have tried.5. Thank you very much for the set of web pages for instructions. I am bookmarking them. Thank you. I might even print them out in case I do not also have my laptop running at the same time. Again. Thank you for your response. I will ponder over all these things and hopefully be patient with the install. Having a memory issue (brain not the PC) I do not even remember which OS I am currently trying.Thank you for your help. Please forgive my ranting. I am upset with my failures to do what I used to do so easily. I have not only installed software, I have built PCs from scratch. I also wrote programs for many companies to include writing software for the V-22 Osprey vertical takeoff aircraft. So, I am frustrated immensely for not doing this right.I know it is not your fault. I am sorry for causing you any pain. Thank you again for the help.","Good luck with it.
