Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...

Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.

I have this item (EC-WS115 Sharper Image Weather Station) new in the box with the install CD, but that only appears to attempt to point to a server that no longer exists. I need the actual file, which apparently is named\u00a0NIS01_INSTALL_2380.exe.Links to dropboxes in the original thread no longer work. Does anyone still have this file available? Sharper Image has been no help and I can't find a trustworthy-looking source online.\u00a0I know this item is fairly old technology, but it seems like a good unit and I'd like to find a way to keep it working vs. adding it to the landfill.\u00a0Any help appreciated.Thanks in advance!","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"I have a mac with a partitioned windows 10 drive which has crashed.?
