I want to record music played on Harmonica along with a backing track played in the background. Probably this is called overdubbing. So can I do this with Voice Recorder. The final recorded music should play both ..the harmonica music and the backing track in sync.Is this possible in Voice Recorder or any other app in Windows 10? If so please give the steps to be followed.Thanks & RegardsJay Sen","solutions":["Hi Jay The best way to do this is with a totally free application called Audacity . . .
