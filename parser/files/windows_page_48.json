I will do my best to help you.For the display option you mentioned in problem number 1, just click on 'Large icons' (as shown in the photo below)For # 2, go to the Device Manager and uninstall the audio drivers and then reinstall them with the latest updated version on the manufacturer's site if possible. Otherwise just uninstall them and restart the pc so that windows reinstalls them.And for the last screeshot you put ... I think you won't like me but the same thing happened to me and the problem was a broken screen ...If you say that your screeshot are normal but not the one taken with your phone, everything suggests that the screen is faulty ... It could be for that it was detected several times in device manager if it tried to reconnect. ....To be sure, if possible, take an hdmi cable and connect your laptop to the television or another screen ... if the image is clean but not on your laptop ... the problem is there."]},{"symptom":"Zune software in 2019        Hello, i have a ZuneHD and want connetc it to my PC.

Sorry for being negative answer here, there is no Zune software provided by Microsoft anymore.Open Device Manager > Click View on top > Show hidden devices > Locate the Zune device > Right click on that and Update driver and see whether it gets detected.","Thank you very much. Just found old instalisation file on my PC, and programm works!\u00a0","Brilliant work.","I had to uninstall my Zune software yesterday as it was preventing the latest Windows update to complete properly.\u00a0 Now I need to reinstall it but I cannot find an installer for it.\u00a0 Would it be possible for you to send me the installer you used so I can try installing it on my Windows 10 system?","wow if you can find this let me know! I found a link to the software but it does not work, it opens and says'to continue, Zune needs to download files to your computer. This might take a while. When the download completes, go to the download location and run the file. Error code 0x80240001 'there is nothing to download though!","Brilliant for him, but the rest of us who still have our Zunes and love them, and the stellar desktop software, are out of luck.It's shameful that Microsoft has pulled some simple files that enable one of their best user experiences. Why? X megabytes in their petabyte cloud? Why can't this continue to work. I'm setting up a new PC to manage my media and I want that software. I know it runs on Win10 because my old HTPC has it installed.","I think I found the correct installer file, but when I run it it just hangs once the install process begins (as shown in the screenshot I attached).\u00a0 I feel like they made some changes in the latest version of Windows 10 and now the Zune software is no longer compatible with it.I have the installer file on my PC, but now I cannot remember what site I downloaded it from.\u00a0 The file is called ZunePackage.exe and has a size of 276,992 KB.\u00a0 I'd share it with you, but not sure how I'd send a file that large.","Sigh. ZunePackage.exe is the (next) missing piece. It's the one the first stage installer (which gets the right .NET Framework) tries and fails to download from Microsoft. Based on the 276K size and the hang, I'd guess that it's trying to pull even more stuff down that also isn't there. Zune is running on my existing Win10 HTPC, so it's not\u00a0completely incompatible.","Thanks.\u00a0 I tried to download a Zune setup file from the Xbox site on Google but ran into the same stopper.\u00a0 Apparently a file is no longer available.\u00a0 I just want to get the Zune program software on my new computer so I can download and play the fifty or so albums\u00a0 that currently live on my Zune device.\u00a0 As it is I have to carry my Zune if I travel and want to access those albums.","It was working on Windows 10 for me until this latest update.\u00a0 When I get the energy I may try to put together a virtual machine running an older version of Windows just to run the Zune software."]},{"symptom":"Windows 10 - Unwanted Pop-up of DOS window: C:\/windows\/system32\/cmd.exe        This pop-up occurs ever so often, and I cannot find any match between what I'm working with and the sudden pop-up.I'm deleting the window, and it does not seem to have inflicted anything on my pc - but a bit annoyingRegards Finn H","solutions":["Hi Finn,I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 3 year Windows Insider MVP here to help.To isolate if it is from a PUP or another Unwanted program, please run Malwarebytes full scan.
