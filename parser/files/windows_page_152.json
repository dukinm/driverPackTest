The problem with Windows 10 is that is constantly updating, and with each update, there are changes made to important system files and registry keys.That is why some Windows updates will delete your restore points, to stop your system becoming a mixture of old and new system files after a System Restore and resulting in a very unstable operating system . . .","Thank you for the reply.

They are connected via DisplayPort to HDMI cable. Both displays are set to 1920 x 1080px (their native resolution). The Dell XPS display is set to scale otherwise everything would be tiny. Also, for more detail, the Asus monitor is my primary (#1) display, and the Dell is display #2.The big and super frustrating problem is that very frequently when the screens gets turned off by the Windows \"Power & sleep\" settings, all my windows on the Dell XPS 13 get moved over to the Asus monitor, as well windowed problems that are not full screen have their position on the display altered. Again, this happens when the displays are turned off by Windows, this is before the computer goes to sleep. When I touch a key or whatnot to wake the displays, they turn on and I see the above issue of moved and resized windows.I am aware of this thread, which is still active, but it is titled Windows 7, and I noticed a Microsoft employee 4 years ago suggested starting a new thread. Since we are now through Windows 8, and on to Win 10, and this is still happening to people, let's start fresh here and get this fixed! Please. Please. Please. I have also tried the reg edits some folks suggested in that old thread with no luck.

What I've noticed:- If I sleep from the Start Menu, then resume using laptop power button (but making sure the monitor itself is resumed first), the desktop layout is correct.- If computer goes to sleep on timeout, then this issue occurs- And I think I know why it only sometimes happens. If I have at least one open application (i.e. web browser) window maximized on my 2nd monitor, the one connected to my laptop via DisplayPort connectin, then when the computer goes to sleep this issue appear to NOT happen.This is a bug with Windows clearly by the number of people reporting it, no way this is isolated to drivers or power plan settings.","Annu -I have a similar problem to Trevor, except with a single monitor. In my case, it's a Dell P2715Q with 3840x2160 resolution, connected via DisplayPort to a desktop using Intel HD Graphics 4600. When the computer puts the screen to sleep, the windows rearrange into the upper-left corner.I've been suffering with the same problem since Windows 7. The suggestion in the thread Trevor links, to edit the settings for the simulated monitor under\u00a0HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\GraphicsDrivers\\Configuration, did not fix the problem under Windows 7, and does not fix the problem under Windows 10.Having researched the problem thoroughly, it's pretty clear what's happening. When Windows puts a monitor connected via DP to sleep, it then detects a device disconnect. In Trevor's case, this leaves his system thinking there's only one monitor. In my case, it means my system gets treated as a headless display with simulated video only. In either case, the windows rearrange.This problem doesn't occur with monitors connected by some other kids of connectors, because Windows doesn't treat them as disconnected when they go to sleep. But do a web search, and you'll see a ton of people complaining about this problem.The solution is to have Windows not treat the monitor as disconnected when the computer puts it to sleep. Is there any way to flag Windows to do that?","I had a very similar problem on a HP Spectre x360 laptop which has a native screen resolution of 1920x1080.\u00a0 I am not using an external monitor. \u00a0After installing Windows 10, the default scaling was set to 150% which I reset to 100% (the other mode would not be useful to me).\u00a0 Upon awaking from sleep windows were resized and moved to the top left (interestingly this did not occur for \u201csettings\u201d -- I didn\u2019t do extensive checking of others native windows 10 routines).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0I tried the solution of modifying the registry but this did not work (see link referred to by Trevor Robertson in this thread).\u00a0 \u00a0One issue is that there was no \u201cSIMULATED\u201d entry under the \u201cGraphicsDrivers\\Configuration\u201d \u00a0to change.\u00a0 I did change the ActiveSize, PrimSurfSize and Stride values for one the configuration entries keys (MHS062\u2026) that had 1024x768 for the sizes.\u00a0 This seemed to help some.\u00a0 Resizing did not occur for all sleep\/wake scenarios but seemed to revolve mostly around activation sleep or waking with the lid. \u00a0(At this point I\u2019m not sure what modes were working properly or not before I made this change.\u00a0 I hadn\u2019t fully realized the extent of the resizing problem when I started looking for a solution.)\u00a0I was about to give up but did one more search which turned up a solution seems to have worked (at least for my case).\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0This link:\u00a0http:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/general-discussion\/11890-intel-nuc-windows-resized-after-waking-sleep.html\u00a0points to a solution (option 2) which is here\u00a0http:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/5990-dpi-scaling-level-displays-change-windows-10-a.html#option2\u00a0The solution is to go to \u201cDisplay\u201d through the \u201cControl Panel\u201d and click on \u201cset custom scaling level\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0 I set the scaling level to \u201c100%\u201d (it was 150%) and this seems to have fixed the problem.\u00a0 \u00a0It is puzzling to me why this \u201cscaling level\u201d was (still) 150% since I has adjusted the scaling to 100% through the Windows 10 Settings by (adjusting the slider in System | Display).\u00a0 Seems like a bug.I'm not sure if editing the registry first was necessary as I left in the original changes I made (and now that it works I figure it best to leave well enough alone).","I do have exactly the same problem since using Windows 10 (clean install).

Lowering the refresh rate on P2715Q to 30Hz helped resolve the issue, at least so far.However, this is pretty lame as it affects the \"motion smoothness\" and generally lowers the quality of the display. It would be great to have a fix that wouldn't require lowering the refresh rate. It seems like this is related to the fact that to use this monitor with 60Hz, the DP port must be in DP 1.2 mode. Somehow either NVIDIA driver or Windows itself (or a combination of both) have issues with this when waking up the monitor from sleep. I saw this issue reported by other folks using a different graphics card (like integrated Intel for example) so I suspect this is a Windows issue rather than a driver issue.It is not a HW issue, because this exact setup works great when running Mac OS X.

I have checked my game log and that has no problem. (verified on AVSIM.At the time of crash my frame rate is above 70fps (CPU nor GPU is struggling)Piriform Speccy shows GPU temps at 65-70 degrees at time of crash.Ryzen master is showing CPU at 55 to 60 degrees at time of crashNeither CPU nor GPU is overclocked.This happens most consistently within 5 mins of starting the game and almost instantly on going to full screen (windowed) mode.All drivers have been updated and no queries\/exclamation marks in the device managerOut of the game scenerio there are no problems whatsoever.Windows 10 64 bit is up to dateI\u00a0 uninstalled and reinstalled Windows and the only thing that changed is that suddenly I am being asked to activate\u00a0 Windows and I do not have the digital key any more. I inserted my original Win 10 product code but it is not being recognised either. I do not believe this is related\u00a0 to the problem but would like to sort this out too,Any ideasTony.","solutions":["Hi Karp. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.1) A Digital License doesn't use a key, except the default key that is present when you skip the key while installing Windows. If you change that to any other key, it will never activate. So, if you did, change it back now:http:\/\/winaero.com\/blog\/generic-key-to-install-... at Settings > Update & Security > Activation > Change Product Key.2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS\/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.If this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here:http:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/support\/... or the Nvidia Update utility here: http:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/Download\/Scan.aspx?lang=e... or the AMD autodect utility here: http:\/\/support.amd.com\/us\/gpudownload\/windows\/P... For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device > Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.You can also try older drivers in Device Manager > Display device > Driver tab > Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick.Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings > System > Display.3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 4) Compare the install you did with this gold standard Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link has ever come back to report problems that I have seen. It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 5) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following this guide to test both sticks and slots:https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Test-PC-RAM-with-MemTest86Run Crucial System Scanner to check the RAM is properly spec'd and configured: https:\/\/www.crucial.com\/usa\/en\/systemscanner?cm... 6) Test the hard drive or SSD with diagnostics: https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/free-hard-drive-testin...https:\/\/mashtips.com\/ssd-health-test-and-perfor...HP and Dell have hardware diagnostics triggered by tapping the ESC or F12 keys respectively as you power on.Best is to use the HDD\/SSD manufacturer's own if there is one, otherwise use Seatools bootable long test:http:\/\/blog.nowherelan.com\/2013\/04\/04\/boot-seat...
