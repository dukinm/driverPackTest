Now I don\u2019t have enough storage to do anything how do I find the updates and delete them?","solutions":["Hi Carlos, I am sorry, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage (29.1GB usable) ask the exact same question here on Community each day . . .Honestly, there is only one answer, backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 - that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . ..Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft.I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GBYou can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PCSince you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issuesClick this link: https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-downlo...to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that toolThen, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10"]},{"symptom":"what is the DU display update on Dell?        what is the DU display update on Dell?\u00a0 My computer will not accept it and I have a Dell computer","solutions":["Hi, My name is Gary an independent advisor and I would be happy to help you out with your concern,Are you referring to dell's dell update package? Dell has a built in software that detects any outdated drivers or bios update and pushes it to the device.I'd recommend updating the driver through the device manager as there are cases that the software fails to proceed with its driver update1. Hold and press the windows key and the X key and choose the device manager 2. Locate the display adapter category and expand it3. Right click your display driver and choose to update Let me know how it goes. :)"]},{"symptom":"Can't find where I saved my photos.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.How were these photos imported? Did you pay attention to where they were going? It's best to put them in the C:\\User Pictures folder which is already linked to the Photos app so they'll display there too.If they're not there then do any of them have names or tags you can search for? If not then can you import them again and this time pay attention they go into the Pictures folder. If you run the import program you used it should tell you where they were put.Let me know what you find. I will be here to help until this case is resolved.","In File Explorer do you have a D:\\ drive?\u00a0 If so add a folder to it and name it Photos.\u00a0 Save your photos there.\u00a0 Then you will know where they are.","Thank you!","Thank you so much!I will try these and be in touch.\u00a0\u00a0","I had to get a new PC and that's where I'm lost.\u00a0 No pictures in folders that I can find.\u00a0 Have a Happy New Year's eve!","Tracie, how did you transfer these pictures? Easiest is to copy them into OneDrive on the old PC, then sign into OneDrive on the new PC to copy them out of OneDrive folder into your Pictures folder. Or copy them to an External or flash drive (so they're also backed up on site as well), then move it to the new PC and copy them out into the User folders.Here are the many ways to copy or move files: https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/2086566\/the-man...","Have you already checked Photos? How about the Pictures file? What do you have set as a default for pictures? If you know\u00a0 the name, photo number or any information about any of the pictures have you searched for them?"]}]}
