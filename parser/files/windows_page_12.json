While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers. 2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/57567-resto... 3) Next try these checklists: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402699... https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/443702\/how-to-fix-sou...4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.

Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

A prompt to restart the computer will show up, choose to restartThis should restart the computer with minimal third party services starting up right after windows boots up. Once the system boots up. After this, try to update again.In the event that it still fails, I would suggest performing an in-place upgrade, this process overrides the system files which would fix corruptions or damages within the system files\/packages while updating the system to the latest version of windows 10.To perform an in-place upgrade, 1. Open this link https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-downlo...2. Select Download tool, and select Run. You need to be an administrator to run this tool.3. On the License terms page, if you accept the license terms, select Accept.4. On the What do you want to do? page, select Upgrade this PC now, and then select Next.5. After downloading and installing, the tool will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC.6. When Windows 10 is ready to install, you'll have an option to keep your personal files and apps, keep personal files, or to keep nothing during the upgrade7. The process would take a while and may consist of multiple reboots. Make sure that there won't be interruption within the process to make sure that everything would sort everything outLet me know how it goes. :)","I already tried the first approach with no success.\u00a0 Now I just tried your in-place upgrade, and my computer says its up to date so I'm hopeful.\u00a0 Thanks for your help.BTW what kind of 3rd party background services would cause this error? I'm running Malwarbytes, IBM Security Trusteer Rapport, and Roboform.\u00a0 Would either of these cause such an error?","Happy to help Jim!
