If Windows won't Upgrade then I'd do the Clean Install which is a much better install anyway and has far less problems than in-place Upgrades. This is the reason no tech enthusiast will even run a Factory or Upgrade install because they'd expect endless issues like this - is this both? Follow the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...
