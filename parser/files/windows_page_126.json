I have tried ALL of them (really, all!), and variations of all of them. None of them work. The thing people giving the solutions don't seem to understand is that the Windows Store app is not installed AT ALL. None of the app's files are to be found on the system. The Powershell command commonly suggested:Get-AppXPackage *Microsoft.WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register \u201c$($_.InstallLocation)\\AppXManifest.xml\u201d}doesn't work (can never possibly work) because the WindowsStore AppXManifest.xml file does not exist. Not anywhere. Not in the C:\\Program Files\\WindowsApps folder (though other app files are there). Not in some hidden folder. Not in ANY folder anywhere on my system. It is gone. It is deceased. It is an EX-AppXManifest.xml file. It has shuffled off this mortal coil. It has gone to meet its maker.Without that file, there does not seem to be any way to (re-)install the WindowsStore app. This is a SILLY situation, a sort of Catch-22: In order to re-install the WindowsStore app, you have to have the WindowsStore app files - yes, the very files you are trying to install!!!The only remnant of the WindowsStore app I have been able to find is a subfolder in the C:\\Users\\[username]\\AppData\\Local\\Packages folder named Microsoft.WindowsStore_8wekyb3d8bbwe. That folder has several subfolders, but they are all empty. In the registry there are a few WindowsStore entries, all either referencing the Packages folder or the WindowsStore license.Given that the WindowsStore files are not there, is there any way to install the WindowsStore app? Is the folder containing the AppXManifest file available anywhere for download? For example the folder for solitaire (which is on my system, and has its AppXManifest file) looks like:Microsoft.MicrosoftSolitaireCollection_4.4.8204.0_neutral_split.scale-125_8wekyb3d8bbweSo presumably there should be a similar folder for WindowsStore, like:Microsoft.WindowsStore_x.x.xxxx.x_neutral_split.scale-125_8wekyb3d8bbwe(which does NOT exist on my system). Is that folder available anywhere for download, and would it help if I had it? Or is there a .appx available for the app?Anything? Please?

A digital license is a hash of your hardware that gets sent to Microsoft, along with the product key that was used to activate Windows on that computer. If you ever need to reinstall Windows, just choose \"I don't have a product key\" during installation. Windows will contact the Microsoft Activation servers after installation, and activate with your digital license.Note: If you activated Windows 10 using a valid Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 product key, you'll also have a digital license.Printed on a Certificate of Authenticity Sticker (Usually older PCs running Windows 7, Vista and XP)If you have an older PC that came with Windows 7 or earlier, the product key is usually found on the Certificate of Authenticity sticker. The sticker is usually located on the underside of laptops, and could be on the top, sides, or bottom of a desktop tower. It looks something like this:Embedded in the UEFI\/BIOS (Usually newer PCs running Windows 8 or Windows 10)Most new PCs sold in stores today come with the product key permanently embedded in the firmware. Instead of printing the product key on a sticker where it could be easily stolen or smudged off, manufacturers are now opting to store it in the UEFI or BIOS. The firmware is located in\u00a0ROM on the motherboard, which means if you upgrade other components like your hard drive, RAM, graphics card, or even your CPU, you should still be able to activate Windows.\u00a0If you reinstall Windows, it will communicate with the firmware to install the embedded key. There is no need to retrieve the key yourself. If you want to retrieve it, you can do so by running the following command in cmd or Windows PowerShell:wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKeyI purchased Windows 10 separately (Retail or OEM licenses)You can purchase Windows 10 as a digital download, or you can buy it in the box at a brick and mortar store.\u00a0- For digital downloads through Microsoft\u00a0You should receive an email with your product key, sent to the Microsoft account that was used to purchase Windows 10 online.
