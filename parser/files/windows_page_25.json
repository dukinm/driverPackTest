I have a questions:1. first I want to repair my windows 10 for this do I need to use system image file from my usb or repair disc?2. While I reset my windows from repair disc will this delete all my computer data also of all partition like b,c,d drives?","solutions":["Hi, My name is Gary an independent advisor and I would be happy to help you out with your concern,To reinstall and repair windows, you'd need to create a bootable usb also known as a repair disk. By reinstalling windows on the bootable media, you'll be able to boot up the usb on the device and you will be directed to the windows set up. On windows set up, you'll be provided a window with your current partition. If you wish to have your other partitions untouched, do not choose to format or delete the other partitions but rather format the partition which consist of the windows installation file. By formatting the boot partition, all the files inside will be removed within the process. You may also choose to select the windows\/boot partition to reinstall windows whereas it will create a windows.old on the C drive which should consist of the user folder and your previous installation files. As for the reset this pc option, by choosing remove everything it will only remove the files where windows is currently installed and the files on the other partitions will remain on its default location.Hope this answers your question. :)","Thanks Gary.But here I have a doubt.
