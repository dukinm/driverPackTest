I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.That message normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.Sometimes this is done by shops or others reinstalling Windows unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS\/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated by free Upgrade or a retail Product Key, and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install, the factory key embedded in the UEFI\/BIOS firmware chip, or the retail key you used. Then we'll see if it activates:1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for your licensed version from here:http:\/\/winaero.com\/blog\/generic-key-to-install-...This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:If it doesn't activate after going online and you originally had factory installed Windows, read the Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware chip at the factory by running ProducKey:http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/produkey-x64.zip, copy and paste the OEM-BIOS key (only) into Settings> Update & Security > Activation.If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it. You can report this to Microsoft here:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/howtotell\/cfr\/r.... In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.You can also contact the seller and let him\/her know you are taking these actions and that they need to make the activation good. Many will comply rather than risk investigation or prosecution.For further assistance restoring the original legal activation you can contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/... I hope having all possible options helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

But how will I know if the\u00a0PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS\/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated by free Upgrade or a retail Product Key?\u00a0","If you don't know that information then what is the full make and model number so I can look up what Windows edition it came with? Check on the sticker on the PC, or by typing System Information in Search box, open SysInfo, scroll down to System Model.So we google the full model + Specs and see what OS it shipped with. Install ProducKey from http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/produkey-x64.zip and look for the OEM-BIOS key. This confirms it came from factory with Windows installed.You said it has Pro.\u00a0 This might mean it actually had Home (most embedded Product Keys are Home) but they wanted to upgrade and used the illegal key to do so.\u00a0 So we can try both, and if neither works try to activate with the OEM-BIOS key.\u00a0 But you have to remove the Volume License key first which I explain how to do in detail in the first post.","The System Info says. \"to be filled by O.E.M\"\u00a0","Here's the specs:","There's no OEM data filled in. Is it a branded PC or a self-build? What brand? Can you examine the stickers on board to see if there's a make and model number?Do you have any paperwork that came with it so you can look for the model, or if a built PC if it came with an OS?If it's a self-build then it wont' be searchable for the OS it shipped with.","Hi! Yes, I purchased it on a store and the PC was actually assembled. All computer parts were just put together. So, there is no way I can have it fixed?\u00a0","What Windows edition came with it? Windows 7, 8, 8.1 or 10? Home or Pro? If you are in doubt and cannot find the paperwork I'd contact the store to ask them. It is a serious crime of felony piracy to sell a PC with preinstalled WIndows that cannot be activated, or uses an illegal Volume License Key. They need to make it good or have a really good explanation. If not you can Report Piracy to Microsoft Usually if you let a senior manager know you are going to do this, they will quickly make it good.\u00a0","It came with Windows 10 and was then upgraded to 10 Pro. I have no idea about licenses and activation. Just today, I have been receiving a message \"license will expire soon.\" I just want it fixed because it's causing me delays of work.\u00a0","Who upgraded it to Windows 10 Pro? A shop?"]},{"symptom":"subliminal program        who shut off the subliminal program on my computer?","solutions":["Hi my name is Ross, I'm an independent advisor. I'd be happy to help with your issue.It sounds like you need to enter the license key which you would have received on the receipt from your original purchase of the app.It\u2019s likely disabled itself until you enter this, so you can provide you have purchased it.Regards, Ross"]}]}
