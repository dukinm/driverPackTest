I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Unfortunately we cannot move the default install location for any apps to an external hard drive. This is because the USB controller is a throttle and could never be as fast as the SATA\/AHCI controller.There is also a speed loss from C drive on an SSD to a HDD to be aware of. A better idea is to keep all apps on the WIndows drive since they write registry keys to Windows which integrate them until they are uninstalled so they should stay on C with the image.What can move without speed loss are User files.
