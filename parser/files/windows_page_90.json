Close task manager and hit apply then ok 8. A prompt to restart the computer will show up, choose to restart This should restart the computer with minimal third party services starting up right after windows boots up. Once the system boots up. After this, try to update again.In the event that it still fails, I would suggest performing an in-place upgrade, this process overrides the system files which would fix corruptions or damages within the system files\/packages while updating the system to the latest version of windows 10.To perform an in-place upgrade, 1.

On the License terms page, if you accept the license terms, select Accept. 4. On the What do you want to do? page, select Upgrade this PC now, and then select Next.5. After downloading and installing, the tool will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC.6. When Windows 10 is ready to install, you'll have an option to keep your personal files and apps, keep personal files, or to keep nothing during the upgrade7. The process would take a while and may consist of multiple reboots. Make sure that there won't be interruption within the process to make sure that everything would sort everything outLet me know how it goes. :)","Gary,thanks you for your prompt reply.I have Windows Version 1509 ( OS Build 18363.535)DISM tool show when I run Image Version 10.018365.535 and keep blinking. no results.Best regards,Jose Luis","Thank you for that information Jose.
