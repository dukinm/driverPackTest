Now you can start OD from Start menu when you need it.","Oh my friend ... it's a lot less complicated than all that. May I help?First, by way of explanation, Microsoft\u00a0is trying to convince Windows users to store their files in OneDrive ... to treat OneDrive as your 'hard drive in the cloud.' There are very good reasons for that, as there are very good reasons why Microsoft sets up Windows 10 by default to use OneDrive as much as possible, which many find sneaky. We can talk about those reasons in another post, if you're interested.For now, here's how to fix things so that files are only stored in OneDrive when\u00a0you want them to be stored there. There are two parts to the process.The first part is to open the OneDrive app and go through its settings. This is something everyone should do, and for all their apps. Software developers routinely turn every feature 'on' so that users can see everything that the app can do. In the case of the OneDrive app, you can tell the app which folders will sync with OneDrive. You can choose any folder or folders, or none at all. You can turn off syncing altogether, if that's what you want. We can easily control what gets synced to OneDrive, if anything.The second part applies if you use Microsoft Office, which you probably do. Microsoft has set the default save location for all Office files - the place where files are saved by default - to OneDrive. You can easily change that, if you want. Just open any Office app and go through its settings until you find the setting where files get saved by default.Let's use Word 365 as an example. Open Word and go to File > Options > Save > Save Documents. That's where you tell Word where to save files.Going forward, you can control what gets saved to OneDrive by adjusting those settings, or by going directly to OneDrive. Just open any web browser and navigate tohttps:\/\/onedrive.live.com\/about\/en-us\/ (in the United States) and drag files onto the browser window.","You can have OneDrive online and all your files available locally as well for when there is no internet access by selecting \"Always keep on this device\".I subscribe to Office 365 Home which has a maximum of 6TB storage space for 6 family accounts, 1TB each.In case someday you may be interested here are the plans:\u00a0\u00a0https:\/\/onedrive.live.com\/about\/en-US\/plans\/","ok guys, I understand how to keep OD from being default.\u00a0 I've been changing \"file save\" location for years.My question is how do I set up new folders that are not defaulted to OD and THEN move my files to those folders.\u00a0If I leave the files where they currently are and try to unlink OD I get the following message \"Your OneDrive files will stop syncing.\u00a0 Locally available files will remain on this device WHILE ONLINE ONLY FILES WILL BE REMOVED\".Since everything was saved automatically on OD will I lose access to these files when I unlink?"]}]}
