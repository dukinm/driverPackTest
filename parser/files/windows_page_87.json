Using profile 2 the pointer is \"hanging\" about once every 20 seconds. When profile 3 is active the mouse is constantly stuttering -> to a point where working with it is almost impossible. (Note that \"best performance\" which should make no compromises in cpu speeds etc. actually yields the worst results here)Lowering the sample rate in the mouse driver helps gradually with every step (250Hz) to the point where at the 250Hz sample rate the problem subsides and the mouse is running smoothly even using energy profile 3(best performance).Now I know what you would think - what's his problem sounds like he's got the fix right at hand.True, though I'm still wondering what's going on with my machine that this problem even occurs - especially since the problem is not connected to increased cpu usage.I tested the mouse on other Laptops and it seems fine.Another mouse model from Roccat has the same stutter problem when used with higher sample rates.Also I tried a really cheap logitech office mouse and it doesn't have any problem (presumably because the sample rate is initially low)Does anyone have a guess what's going on here and if there might be a real fix for the problem instead of a work around?Thanks in advance and cheers to all who made it to the bottom of this essay =)","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"update error 0xa00000400        error 0xa0000400\u00a0\u00a0","solutions":["Hello!
