This just suddenly happened midday.I have tried the recommended uninstalling and reinstalling the driverI have windows 10 on ASUS X555L.

The only explanation is this is an issue with a driver or new update","solutions":["Hi Melika. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Update the Trackpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, go to Mice > Touchpad and then Driver tab. Choose Update Driver, then Automatic to see if it gets a better driver that resolves the problem. If not try Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick to try all previously installed drivers. If that doesn't work then try uninstalling driver, Restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.See the troubleshooting steps here: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402786...
