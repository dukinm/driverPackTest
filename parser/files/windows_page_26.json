This happens at least a dozen times a day.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Make sure you only have one installed antivirus and if you want best Windows performance it should be only Defender gives best Windows performance, is built in, has least issues and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.Malwarebytes is the undisputed best on-demand scanner and it has the best anti-spyware app built into it now, so you don't need dated SAS which no expert has recommended for 8 years.If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in 1) Safe Mode with Networking (so you have internet) or 2) Safe Mode accessed by one of the illustrated steps in this guide:https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/4-ways-boot-saf... 1) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... -------------------------------------------- But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues.

I also did a complete uninstall of all three browsers, drivers are all up to date, checked apps to make sure they are working perfectly and spent a few hours cleaning unneeded pictures, documents, etc out of the folders.\u00a0There were no damaged files found during the process which was a good thing but it was still freezing.\u00a0So today will be the real test as far as if all these steps fixed the issue. I use the desktop version of Instagram and that is the only thing I can see that is still freezing. I completely uninstalled it and reinstalled but it still seems to freeze. Of course there is never a way to get help with program. It is the messenger part of it that is having the issue but I can live with that.\u00a0I am thinking I need to increase the memory as it's a tad on the low side so I'll order that and see if that helps with the overall issue.

I assume like most of us your a busy person.Just something interesting. After I went through all of the process you suggested and things were working well they started up again.Like I said I did a complete uninstall of Chrome and Firefox thinking that was the issue. Every trace of those two were removed.Someone suggested Vivaldi because I don't use a cell phone and I have a Instagram account. Vivaldi if the only browser that allows you to upload images and send messages right from their browser. Otherwise you have to have a app which means each time you want to do something you have to bring the app up. I was having trouble with that crashing or freezing also. So I installed the Vivaldi and haven't had a issue since. No freezing, no crashing. And super fast with the addition of not having to launch the Instagram app each time. I was told by a few people that Windows doesn't like to play nicely with Chrome and I think in my case that was the issue.\u00a0Again, thanks for your help.","hi my name annnmarie\u00a0 iand try\u00a0 updata window and said that im missing\u00a0 improtnat scertiy device so how can get\u00a0 that\u00a0 deivce","im\u00a0 try up date\u00a0 window\u00a0 it \u00a0 keep\u00a0 said\u00a0 improtnat security device is missing\u00a0 os \u00a0 how \u00a0 do I find \u00a0 that device\u00a0"]},{"symptom":"System restore in Win 10 taking a long time maybe idle        I had to system restore my desktop from win 10 but its stuck 4 hours now on \"file and settings are being restored system restore is initialising\".Has it crashed in which case in order to stop it I should kill the power? or shall I let it continue?How long is it likely to take if it should be left working on?many thanks","solutions":["Hi parthampatis It depends really on the amount of data, as a rule if that is stuck in the 'files and settings' phase, the best option is to let that continue, even though it has been 4 hours, it is only really if it gets stuck in the 'Restoring the Registry' phase for a long time, that would indicate the restore process is not going to complete . . .","thanks very much.The C drive is an 500MB SSD with minimal amount of data.
