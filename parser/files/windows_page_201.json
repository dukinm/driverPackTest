However, the option won't perform any repairs.To check for issues within the image with DISM, use these steps: Open Start. Search for Command Prompt, right-click the top result, and select the Run as administrator option.Type the following command to perform a quick health check and press Enter: DISM \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/CheckHealth Once you complete the steps, the command will run and verify if there is any data corruption that needs fixing.Checking issues with DISM using ScanHealth option Alternatively, you can run DISM with the ScanHealth option to perform a more advanced scan to check if the Windows 10 image has any problems.To perform an advanced scan with DISM, use these steps: Open Start. Search for Command Prompt, right-click the top result, and select the Run as administrator option.Type the following command to perform an advanced DISM scan and press Enter: DISM \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/ScanHealth After you complete the steps, the advanced scan will take several minutes to determine if the local image needs repairing.Repairing issues with DISM using RestoreHealth option If there are issues, then you can use DISM with the RestoreHealth option, which will run an advanced scan and repair any problems automatically.Open Start. Search for Command Prompt, right-click the top result, and select the Run as administrator option.Type the following command and press Enter: DISM \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/RestoreHealth While the command is running is normal to see the process stuck at 20 or 40 percent, after a few minutes, the process will complete successfully.Once you complete the steps, the Deployment Image Servicing and Management tool will connect to the Windows Update servers to download and replace any damaged files in the local image for Windows 10 as necessary.Hope this helps.","Jon,Thank you for your expeditious reply.

The Night Light icon becomes active, but the Night Light itself does not work. When you you close the notification area and re-open it the Night Light is not active again and switching it on leads to the same behaviour. It just does not become active.\u00a0\u00a0This would not be a major issue if it didn't have a strange side-effect. When you have tried switching on the Night Light, log off the current user and login as a different user you cannot select the Display Settings anymore from the desktop. It briefly opens and closes again in a few seconds without any error message on the screen. In the event viewer you can find an event which doesn't really helpFaulting application name: SystemSettings.exe, version: 10.0.18362.449, time stamp: 0x066bf1a5Faulting module name: msvcrt.dll, version: 7.0.18362.1, time stamp: 0xf5bdefd7Exception code: 0x40000015Fault offset: 0x000000000000ae72Faulting process id: 0x12b8Faulting application start time: 0x01d5a6b1d5a9de26Faulting application path: C:\\Windows\\ImmersiveControlPanel\\SystemSettings.exeFaulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\msvcrt.dllReport Id: bbc1cafd-5319-4a17-960d-37a61804b485Faulting package full name: windows.immersivecontrolpanel_10.0.2.1000_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewyFaulting package-relative application ID: microsoft.windows.immersivecontrolpanel\u00a0Other settings are still available like Sound or Battery but selecting Display Settings results in the Settings closing.You will also find that when logged in as the other user you cannot select the Night Light from the notification area as it is greyed out so now the Night Light is broken and the Display Settings are broken.\u00a0Every user that logs on to the laptop from that moment on has problems with the display settings. It won't work again.The user logged on when you tried turning on the Night Light can still use the Display Settings and switch on the Night Light (still doesn't work). If however you delete the profile from the laptop and log back in with a fresh profile the Display Settings are also broken and the Night Light feature is unavailable.\u00a0After creating a dump when the Display Settings crashed I noticed a reference to\u00a0bluelightreduction which is a registry entry used for Night Light. I compared the registry from a working system with a broken system and it turned out that on the broken system the key 'HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\CloudStore\\Store\\DefaultAccount' was missing\u00a0\u00a0After exporting this key from a working system and importing it on the broken system everything is working again.

The night light is broken again and if you log back in with the previous user the night light is also broken. You can select it and activate it but it doesn't work anymore. Display Settings is still working, but clicking on the Night Light settings results in the closing of the settings screen and an error in the event log.\u00a0Naam van toepassing met fout: SystemSettings.exe, versie: 10.0.18362.449, tijdstempel: 0x066bf1a5Naam van module met fout: SettingsHandlers_Display.dll, versie: 10.0.18362.1, tijdstempel: 0xac1c53a8Uitzonderingscode: 0x80000003Foutmarge: 0x000000000001e0c4Id van proces met fout: 0x2490Starttijd van toepassing met fout: 0x01d5a8f38759559cPad naar toepassing met fout: C:\\Windows\\ImmersiveControlPanel\\SystemSettings.exePad naar module met fout: C:\\Windows\\System32\\SettingsHandlers_Display.dllRapport-id: 2da54e96-c90f-4d0b-93ff-09abbaaab155Volledige pakketnaam met fout: windows.immersivecontrolpanel_10.0.2.1000_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewyRelatieve toepassings-id van pakket met fout: microsoft.windows.immersivecontrolpanelWith Windows 10 1803 Enterprise (10.0.17134.1130)\u00a0 it works fine and keeps on working with every user that uses the system.\u00a0\u00a0After upgrading from Windows 10 1803 to Windows 10 1909 the night light is no longer working and I cannot select the night light settings anymore. It results in the above error. If I revert the operating system back to Windows 10 1803 everything works as expected again. Night Light is fine, choosing the Night Light settings is fine.
