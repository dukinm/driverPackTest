GeForce 210 GPU. Windows 10 Pro x64 - Latest build.This is the first report I could find explaining the exact same symptoms. I have noticed the following:This is a rare but extremely frustrating issue.It can occur on the top or at the bottom of the window, but not limited to just those areas.The issue only occurs with maximised windows and does not seem to affect all apps.This problem can be evasive and has been occurring intermittently in the past. It comes and goes depending on what apps are open.Some have reported that Office Protected View could be a trigger, but disabling this only works in limited cases.Troubleshooting Steps Performed: (Since April\/May 2018)Update WindowsUpdate all Affected AppsClean Install new display driversClean bootSFC scan and DISMCheck event viewerRun affected apps in compatibility modeUninstall all OEM softwareUninstall all non-essential appsUninstall all graphics driversReplace graphics card (AMD and NVIDIA)Remove graphics card altogether and run integrated GPU onlyUpdate BIOSDisable CPU Virtualization Features in BIOSReplace PC Tower - Latest W10 PRO x64 Clean Install on New PCReplace both Monitors with 2x New Identical Monitors - Both connected via digital outputsFindings:None of my troubleshooting steps have yeilded any results. The issue always returns eventually.We seriously need some action from Microsoft regarding this issue.Possible Cause:Due to the scope of affected apps and the fact that only multiple display setups seem to be affected I suspect this may be a display driver\/hardware\/configuration compatibility issue\/conflict probably related to a recent windows 10 update since build 1703\/1803 causing display issues. Temporary Workarounds:This is a quick and easy workaround: SHIFT + CTRL + WIN + B This key sequence empties the video buffer and restarts the driver, and does the same for the keyboard, the mouse and the soundcard. It was meant for helping some users and techs with stuck graphic elements, black screens, stuck sleep modes, stuck mouse buttons and buzzing or looping sounds. The issue will return eventually.Limited successChanging the primary monitor or just slightly changing the layout of multiple monitors and clicking apply resolves the issue for an unknown amount of time.Limited successWhen I use shift + right click on the taskbar icon of the affected application and select 'restore window' the interface returns, but when I maximise again it the issue returns.This is my personal choice. You can effectively work around the issue by avoiding the symptoms.Any window showing the issue symptoms need to be restored as above and NOT MAXIMISED AGAIN.Snapping Windows to the Left or Right side of a display and resizing them sideways is a quick way of using non-maximised during multi tasking workflows.Success may be limitedSome apps that support Full screen mode (Not to be confused with maximized mode) can be restored by hitting the F11 key to enable full screen and hitting F11 again to exit full screen. My interface then returns, however, some apps like Acrobat Reader DC does not respond to F11 because it has it's own full screen shortcut which will also work the same way.This would be my second choice due to how quick you can tap F11 twice. Once you re-open or move the window the symptoms could return (If in maxmised state)Success may be limitedPossible Solution:There have been reports that the following third party hotfix fixed the issue. You may want to create a system restore point before trying this:Link - Third Party HotfixLink - How to create a restore pointLimited successChanging to a single display setup may get rid of the symptoms completely. Very inconvenient, but may be viable if you can get by with one display and you have no viable\/effective workarounds.Not tested yet, but someone can confirm if this helps them.

I've been using Windows 10 for a while now. For the most part, I like it. There have been some good additions like virtual desktops, the merged Win8 start screen and Traditional windows start menu, and it's got some nifty internal stuff going on. The most obvious flaw is the search feature.I get it. It would be nice to have a search bar that let's you type stuff in and search your apps, your files, and the internet all at once. In theory it's an interesting tool. \"Cortana\", however, has some glaring issues that make it basically useless for everyday use. If going into my \"All Apps\" section to find what I need is easier than searching, you've failed.Issue 1: Incremental ResultsAgain, this seems like a cool feature: change the results on the fly as I type in what I want to search for, then stream in results as they come in rather than posting a progress bar. Seems like it would be neat. It's not though, since there isn't any way for me to be sure that the search is complete, and incoming results change the position of the currently displayed results. That means if I've already found the app I want and am trying to click on it, it can suddenly be replaced with a completely separate app, or file, or website. This defeats the only practical benefit of HAVING streaming results in the first place.\u00a0 Add to that a system that gives you just enough time to refresh after typing additional search words to move your mouse to a result that's about to disappear, and you've got yourself a frustrating and useless feature.Issue 2: Failure to detect exact resultsThis is a big one. There are a large number of times where \"Cortana\" will fail to detect exact matches in the start menu, instead suggesting obscure system\/program files. This is the MINIMUM a search feature on the start menu should do. This alone gets the system an F. Issue 3: Bing and EdgeI don't know why Microsoft thought they needed a web search engine, but that's fine. Forcing me to use it is NOT fine. It is the furthest thing from fine I can imagine. Forcing users into a single web search provider is anti-competitive, pointless, and cripples the usefulness of the feature to the point where it's basically useless. Add in the fact that it launches Edge instead of the default browser, and you've turned your search feature into an invasive parasite.Issue 4: Greedy IndexingIndexing the file system can be a lot of work. USUALLY this runs when the computer is idle, but I've had many instances where the Indexing Service decides to run in the middle of a hard drive speed test, or during a game, ruining both. Some other new services also seem to have a hard time detecting whether or not the computer is being used.These things need to be fixed. I'm sure people have other complaints, as do I, but these are the major ones that make the current system a mess to use. What do other people think? What other improvements could be made?","solutions":["I like the O\/S generally but hate the way it fails so often when searching for files and documents on the PC it allegedly operates...Definitely don't like the way it updates as and when it sees fit rather than waiting until I choose to apply the updates.Do not like the way it merges my skype accounts regardless of my choice.The help function redirecting to the MS forums where MS reps can chose their own replies as answers does not work too well either. Just like the site busy fault that often occurs.","I'm really frustrated with the search on Win10 - thanks for articulating the issues I am experiencing. You can't even turn off the web search anymore ( or adjust it to use a different search engine ).

The icon you have circled is the correct icon for \"System and security\".","Well that is abit odd cause it should have some shield Icon or something and not a blank icon or Icon that ussually presents something that is missing. For example Discord is a very known Company but I had same Icon for the Program as for \"System and security\". If U are telling the truth than Ok but it should be different. Tnx","My Troubleshoot section in Control Panel looks just the same as yours, the icon you circled is the same.","Here I show U what I meant why does Discord have blank icon as well as screenshot program very common and it doesn't get fixed I mean idk is it fabric \"Bug\" or Publisher was lazy to cover theyre logo in Program Files? I tryed once reinstall same story but some people know the answer and I wish to hear it. Tnx\u00a0 https:\/\/prnt.sc\/qmqgfj","No idea, just the way it is I suppose.Hopefully \"someone who knows the answer\" will answer you in this thread.","You're looking at Control Panel and not Settings. Settings will have the shield. Control Panel has what you see."]},{"symptom":"Newly built PC Windows 10 - No Brightness Control        The monitor is iiyama ProLite E2483HS connected with HDMI to new PC with licenced and registered copy of Windows 10.
