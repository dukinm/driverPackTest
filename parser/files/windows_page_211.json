The usually recommended solution is to specify a frame color. Unfortunately, this changes also the color of the title bar, which to me is not aesthetical and disturbing. Thus the shadows under the windows is my preferred way of still seeing where an explorer-window stops.For the past few weeks now, \"something\" in my computer has been constantly removing the selection \"Show shadows under windows\" in the Performance Options! I put the mark, and sure enough, after half an hour or so the box is unchecked again and gone are the shadows. I had to put a shortcut to the settings on the desktop, but this is not the way to go, and the problem is maddening. So: what is this? A bug in the latest Windows Update? A program that changes the setting without asking (maybe trying to enhance the performance)? I've seen one or two people having the same problem, but they don't seem to have gotten any solution to the mystery.Please HELP !(P.S.\u00a0 If no solution is to be found, I would kindly ask Microsoft to disconnect frames from title bars, so as to make it possible to specify a frame color and leave the title bar alone.)","solutions":["Music to my ears Louis!

I only found out about it because I went to purchase Outer Worlds and discovered that my OS is somehow out of date? My question is simple. Will I lose data from updating to this new version of windows? Specifically will I lose saved game data\/installs on other games I have on my computer? Also, some of my games are quite old (windows 95 era) but are currently functioning on my current Windows 10 build, will I need to re-patch them? Also my apologies if this is a stupid\/obvious question...","solutions":["1909 is almost a non-event compared with the tedious large version updates that came before.The chance of the update causing issues is also far smaller because of the small update. You would haveto be very unlucky for your game saves and settings to go missing.Regardless. You should backup all of your game files. Your SSD\\HDD could fail without warning at any time.Having said that, if you have updated to 1903 without issues updating to 1909 will be over and done before you know it.There shouldn't be any new problems with your old games, but there is no guarantee with Win10 version updates, and problemsfrom version updates are probably more common with disc based games.My few '90's games are still fine, and I don't know if it was v1909 for sure,\u00a0 butDues Ex-Invisible War has a big problem (long story below)it didn't have a while back, and I think I fired it up after 1903 update. The original Deus Ex runs without any problems though.------------\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ----------( the long story... )To run the Deus Ex-IW I have to jump through some hoops. I have to open Task Manager on another monitor becausethe game crashes when\u00a0 loading the gameplay after the setup screens. The main screen locks on to a black screen and won't Alt\\TAB back to the desktop, but with Task Manager on monitor2 I canAlt\\TAB to monitor 2.Then I have to end one of the Deus Ex tasks, and the Task re-starts automatically and the game comes good.But only while in the same area. It also crashes between scenes which make the problem untenable because youchange areas a fair bit. I have a copy of Win7 on another SSD which still runs the game without a problem..","Hi, My name is Gary an independent advisor and I would be happy to help you out with your concern,The 1909 version has been released sometime in november, you may review the changes via this linkhttps:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/4524570Normally feature updates such as this one mostly includes improvements, and added features for the system. This will not have any effects with third party applications as they would have an entirely different source path.
