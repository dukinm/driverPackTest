Our company uses numeric codes to identify projects.For example, a specific project, assigned the job number 111-44-23, will be found here:P:\\111\\44\\23When navigating File Explorer, I find it very helpful to use the number keys; for example I would enter: \"111\" <Enter> \"44\" <Enter> \"23\" <Enter> to navigate to this job folder. However, I've found that any time I enter two duplicate numerals in sequence (11 or 44 in this example) the second keystroke starts moving the selection down one folder as if I were pressing the down arrow key.For example; when I enter \"111\" in file explorer, the first stroke selects folder \"110\", the second stroke moves the selection down to \"111\" and the third moves the selection down to folder \"112\".Whereas; if I enter \"121\", the folder \"121\" is selected.","solutions":["Your keystrokes will look at the leftmost character in the file\/folder name only, from top to bottom.
