{"windows":[{"symptom":"System freeze during file transfer left volume bitmap error on secondary exFAT HDD        So, I've searched Google and various Windows 10 forums & support sites regarding this issue. Nothing I've read so far has answered my question so I figured I'd try to explain the issue here. My undying gratitude ahead of time if anyone can give me an answer other than \"reformat it\". I'll add as much info as I can but if anyone needs to know something specific, ask and I'll get it!TL;DRRunning chkdsk D: \/f \/r \/x from an Admin cmd results in \"could not repair disk. An error was encountered while examining the volume bitmap.\" Running from Disk Management results in \"found disk errors it can't repair. Select 'OK' then try repair again.\" FSUtils reports the drive flagged as dirty but if chkdsk can't complete\/repair the drive, how do I fix the volume bitmap?QUESTIONS1. Will manually clearing the dirty bit with a HEX editor make the drive usable again?2. If Windows 10 still has File Explorer issues, will the same thing happen again as soon as I try to move a new MKV file to the drive?------------------------------OS & SYSTEM INFOWindows 10 Home 64-bit v1909OS Build 18363.535ASUS P8Z77-V Pro, BIOS v2104Intel i5 3.4GHz\u00a016gb RAMNvidia GTX 1060 w\/ latest driversBoot Disk: Samsung SSD 860 EVO 1TB, Single NTFS partitionSecondary Disk: Western Digital Blue 4TB, Single exFAT partitionBACKSTORYThe HDD in question is the Western Digital Blue 4TB. I only use it for movie storage accessed via PLEX on our home network.Prior to the Windows 10 1903 update, File Explorer had an issue transferring large files (like an MKV BluRay rip from our movie collection). I had a different drive at that point (2TB Seagate from\u00a0 2012 w\/ 2 NTFS partitions), but the same issue as this one: While moving an MKV file, transfer status would slowly drop to 0Kb\/sec and stall, then the system would freeze\/become unusable forcing me to reboot which made the drive report as read-only. That brought my PLEX media center project to a halt. Soon after, the Windows 10 1903 update was released which I read \"fixed the file transfer problem\", so I installed the update, backed up my movie collection, reformatted the drive, and all was fine until the Seagate died (7 years, RIP) at which point I bought the WD Blue 4TB.Everything was great until the Windows 10 1909 update and suddenly, the exact same scenario happened. MKV transfer stalls, system freezes, I hit reset, and the drive is read-only.After searching Google for help, everything I read said \"use chkdsk D: and some combo of \/f, \/r, or \/x to fix and recover after un-mounting the drive, however running chkdsk via Admin cmd came back with \"could not repair disk. An error was encountered while examining the volume bitmap.\" I think I read that the volume bitmap (allocation bitmap\/table) is an exFAT specific thing which helps in getting more space out of a drive. Exactly why I formatted the drive exFAT when I bought it.I ran an \"is dirty\" check and yes, it has a dirty bit. At this point I check the Event View and it's logging an Event ID 153 warning every 1-2 minutes which reads \"The IO operation at logical block address 0x10140 for Disk 1 (PDO name: \\Device\\0000035) was retired\". Following the Event Log Online Help link gets me to info about drive failure which the chkdsk error would seem to confirm, but running the WD SMART scan on the drive, everything returned says the drive is 100% healthy. I then find a comment in another post which says a hard reset while the drive was performing an operation could also result a volume bitmap error. Exactly my scenario.I fixed the read-only lock, but I get the same chkdsk error when I try to repair it, even running it in safe mode and for some reason chkdsk won't run a disk scan on boot-up no matter how I try it. I read that you can manually clear a dirty bit on a drive, using WinHex or a tool called DMDE\u00a0 but will that clear the error and return the drive to its \"pre-transfer freeze\" usable state? I also read that File Explorer in Windows 10 is still jacked up so will getting the drive back up even matter or will the same thing happen as soon as I attempt a 2GB file transfer?I hope someone gets this and can offer an answer other than a LONG backup process and drive format!","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"CAN I SWITCH WINDOWS 7 TO WINDOWS 10?        \u00a0 I HAVE A WINDOWS 7 AND CANNOT AFFORD A NEW COMPUTER.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.That message normally means that someone has activated Windows with a Volume License Key meant only for business or organizations that activate a large number of PC's, which need to check in with the organization's server regularly to reactivate.Sometimes this is done by shops or others reinstalling Windows unnecessarily because the PC either came with a Windows Product Key embedded in the BIOS\/UEFI firmware, or it was already activated by free Upgrade or a retail Product Key, and would have reactivated after a reinstall had they given it the chance and not interrupted this by installing the illegal key.If you know Windows was originally activated legitimately by one of these methods then to fix the problem what I would do is go offline to remove the Volume License key and then restore the Generic Product Key that is used to activate with the Digital License issued by Upgrade or Factory install, the factory key embedded in the UEFI\/BIOS firmware chip, or the retail key you used. Then we'll see if it activates:1) Go offline by opening Action center at the right end of Task Bar, then clicking on Airplane mode to turn off internet.2) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click to Run as Administrator, then right click to copy and paste this command in and press Enter: slmgr -upk3) Restart PC and then insert Generic Product Key for your licensed version from here:http:\/\/winaero.com\/blog\/generic-key-to-install-...This sets everything back to default so that if there is a Digital License issued during a proper Upgrade it should reactivate within a few days. If not we will need to try something else:If it doesn't activate after going online and you originally had factory installed Windows, read the Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware chip at the factory by running ProducKey:http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/produkey-x64.zip, copy and paste the OEM-BIOS key (only) into Settings> Update & Security > Activation.If you were sold a Volume license product key or the PC came from seller activated with one, then It is piracy when someone resells Windows with no way to legally activate it. You can report this to Microsoft here:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/howtotell\/cfr\/r.... In the past when victims cooperated with an investigation they would sometimes give them a free copy as thanks.You can also contact the seller and let him\/her know you are taking these actions and that they need to make the activation good. Many will comply rather than risk investigation or prosecution.For further assistance restoring the original legal activation you can contact Microsoft Support phone or chat options here:https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/...
