There was no option to switch it back to 1920x1080, so I had to put it to 1600x1200 just to more easily see what was going on. I also checked my graphics driver, and it said it was up to date, so I don't know what happened. I think it happened because I had kept on pressing the windows key to exit the game temporarily, but I have no idea if this is the case. Hopefully someone knows what to do. I'll have to use 1600x1200 for now.","solutions":["Hi, Are you able to see 1920x1080 under Settings > System > Display > Display Resolution? Full screen programs are able to change the resolution which can lead to issues occasionally when switching between the two as your display resolution changes when you alt tab (or hit the windows key). Every time this happens the desktop is redrawn. If you want to avoid this and make switching quicker try running supported games in borderless window mode. Effectively running the game as a normal window just cutting off the Windows UI. Means the desktop is always drawn out so switching is quicker. I hope that helps.","Nope, no option for 1920x1080, but thanks for the advice!","What's listed as Recommended on the drop down?
