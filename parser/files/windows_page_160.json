At this point everything works as it should, but once I start running applications - let it be Edge or whatever - LogiOptionsMgr.exe disappears from the processes list (there's no information that it crashed or anything). Mouse and keyboard are still working, but once LogiOptionsMgr.exe closes, I lose possibility to use customized buttons (I have Mx Master S2 mouse + Craft keyboard and I do a lot of video editing, so this feature is very important to me!). In event viewer there's an error:Faulting application name: LogiOptionsMgr.exe, version: 7.14.70.0, time stamp: 0x5d1858e5Faulting module name: LogiOptionsMgr.exe, version: 7.14.70.0, time stamp: 0x5d1858e5Exception code: 0xc0000409Fault offset: 0x000000000067ee90Faulting process id: 0x128cFaulting application start time: 0x01d5513156b00a32Faulting application path: C:\\ProgramData\\Logishrd\\LogiOptions\\Software\\Current\\LogiOptionsMgr.exeFaulting module path: C:\\ProgramData\\Logishrd\\LogiOptions\\Software\\Current\\LogiOptionsMgr.exeReport Id: 31e18188-71fd-450a-abc1-0abc119b7982Faulting package full name: Faulting package-relative application ID: I have no idea what's causing LogiOptionsMgr.exe to close\\crash, but I've already tested some things:1. It happens with every version of Logitech Options.2. I thought that maybe some driver\/app was causing it to act like that, so I installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 1903 and then, before installing any driver\/app, I ran the newest version of Logitech Options - LogiOptionsMgr.exe crashed\/disappeard from the processes list right after I ran some other application.3. I suspected that perhaps the newest version (1903) of Windows 10 is causing these problems, so I did a fresh install of 1803 version which worked with no issues on my old PC (Asus P8Z77-V, Intel 3770K, Corsair Vengeance 16GB). That didn't help either. LogiOptionsMgr.exe was crashing again.4. Since I switched from Intel to AMD and this issue started happening, I think the problem lies in the platform (AMD\/Asus). In my workplace I use the PC with Ryzen 2700X cpu and the newest version of Windows 10 on which the Logitech Options software is working flawlessly. That means it must be the new platform that's causing problems (maybe the bios, maybe some driver; perhaps Win10 doesn't work with it properly yet - I don't know).Since I'm not sure where I should address this issue, I'm reporting it to AMD, Asus, Microsoft and Logitech.In the meantime, does anyone have any ideas on how to fix it?Thanks!","solutions":["Hi, did you look for updated BIOS? Can you try to downclock memory slightly?","Thank you for your reply. The BIOS I'm currently using is the newest one (2501) available on Asus website.I don't think downclocking memory would help to fix my issue as it's the only app\/process I'm having problems with.","Please try to repair system files by DISM.exe \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/RestoreHealth command from Windows PowerShell (administrator) environment. I do not think it should help but there is no harm in trying.","Unfortunately, that didn't work either. I also tried to install Logitech Options in safe boot mode, but with the same result. Any other ideas?","I suggest to downclock CPU and RAM as low as possible. Just for test. In very rare cases RAM or cache or other modules may operate with certain code sequences incorrectly.","Tried that today as well - again, no luck. Is there any way to send this issue to Microsoft so they can look into it or something?","The problem is with Logitech file so it is better to ask help from Logitech support.","I wouldn't be so sure it's Logitech's fault...Can't believe it, but I've managed to fix this issue! Believe it or not, but it was the account name that was causing the problem. I thought that with a new Windows installation I would finally change my nickname I've been using for years to my name and surname. I'm from Poland and my name and surname have polish characters in it - maybe that's the reason. Anyway, I created a new account with my nickname, installed Logitech Options and it worked! Then I switched to my name\/surname account and Logitech Options crashed. Just to be sure, I've installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 1903, created an account with my nickname and now Logitech Options is working great.","Great! Glad to see your problem solved. But I recommend to file a bug report to Logitech support.","I wouldn't be so sure it's Logitech's fault...Can't believe it, but I've managed to fix this issue!
