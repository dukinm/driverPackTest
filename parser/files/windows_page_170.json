BUT!! at no point was I told what you surely must have known was an issue or even asked me for more information to get to the root of the problem, it's taken me many hours looking at all kinds of things trying everything to solve the issue, what can I say too many default replies the first person that helped me was by far the most useful.How is this even a thing your microsoft your meant to understand how all this works WHQL all the testing how do you manage to put out an update that breaks so many peoples perfectly functioning devices, I know I'm not alone there are loads of people having issues with these kind of things.So I am stuck on wifi with the only option being to completely reinstall windows but your just force updates upon me and then the pattern repeats.It's real simple fix the problem it's driving people crazy you know it's there but on these forums I see no mention about certain brands of cards being basically driver bricked or software bricked by one of these updates you have forced upon us.I really miss having full control of my computer I want you to go back to the old way of things if I don't want the update I should be allowed to take my own risk and ignore it and delete it this new way of doing things is not working.By all accounts you've even changed the way you do your hardware testing for updates so no wonder it's all so broken for so many people right now it really does make me angry but I'm only stating my opinion and no doubt it won't get far enough up the list or enough attention to make any difference to this current train wreak.","solutions":["I have a similar problem, especially after updates to v1903 and now v1909. I have three Win10 Pro machines and one Win 10 Home machine. Only the WIN10 Home machine communicates two ways with the rest.

I have unplugged and reset the Hitron modem\/router. They all reach the two printers on the system.Over the past two years I have fought this repeatedly, and as soon as a new update is installed, they are screwed. The update on one device somehow even affects those that are not updated.The only good one is the old WIN 10 Home, maybe because I have not recently updated it!I do not want remote service anymore either, because in most instances the original problem has been made worse, and I have even had to resort to\u00a0 complete reinstall of Windows.

I have had days when I have reset NICs by uninstall, reboot and update drivers on four devices. Sometimes all four discover and talk to each other. Sometimes they discover but talk in one direction only. Sometimes every device communicates two ways with each other. Then the next day they one device or another or all fail to discover anything. I don't know how many times I have written down the status and behaviour of each device, and on the next day or reboot, they display a completely different status or behaviour.Getting Support requires a clear definition of the issue, and that seems impossible. It keeps changing. The settings for communication seem to get changed without me doing anything. Why would things like \"network discovery\" change to \"off\" without me doing anything. Or \"you are not connected to any network\"? One PC in particular ometimes cannot even discover itself when selecting Network on Windows Explorer. In that state, it may communicate with other PCs, but they cannot find that machine. Every machine can print on either of our two Ethernet printers.It doesn't matter whether some are on ethernet or all on WiFi. I purchased a separate NIC Server PCIe to determine if the MoBo network function was faulty. Nope. With that card in place the \"sometimes\" functions also occurred.MS Support is very weak on networking. I am being generous.","It just gets worse each day. Once in a while I get four or five devices all in communication, and I think 'Aha'. Then at some time later in the day or the next day one or more fail to detect or communicate only in one direction.

Like the person who posted it, I too can not connect to Miracast AFTER the 1909 Windows update.\u00a0 We used to be able to connect to Miracast before the update. The Big Problem with Microsoft and this update is that it has caused a multitude of PC's not to\u00a0 be able to use this feature anymore. A matter of fact, after I had updated my PC,\u00a0 it was stated in the new 1909 Windows system that my PC was no longer capabable of Miracast. This is Big Problem for those who need their PC's to do wireless presentations. Microsoft please provide a fix for this issue immediatlely!"]},{"symptom":"Links on Emails not connecting        After clicking on a hyperlink from the Mail App. version of Hotmail a msg. comes up\u00a0 stating cannot connect and thats it.\u00a0 Presumably I've clicked on some option somewhere that inadvertently has this outcome but have little idea where to start.","solutions":["Hi DC.
