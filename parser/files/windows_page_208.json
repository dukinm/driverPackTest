I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I would uninstall Java from Settings > Apps > Apps & Features and only reinstall it if you're prompted that an app needs it, and maybe even reconsider using the App since Java is a real security risk.No expert in Forums - where we see the most cases, by the thousands - recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.After uninstalling antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.If you want the best on-demand scanner download and install Malwarebytes from https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/mwb-download\/ In it's Settings > Protection > Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits. Then on Scan tab choose Threat Scan and Run Scan. Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean. If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings > Accounts tab.Next check for damaged System Files since the problem anti-viruses can damage WIndows:https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...

I'll give you everything possible for repairing Bluetooth that works for others. If it fails then because you Clean Installed you may need to reinstall Version 1903 to restore Bluetooth, or you can temporarily replace it with a USB nano BT receiver below. Be sure to also report to Insider forum so they know about this. I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority. Many problems right now are being solved by updating to the latest version so if you want to skip to that step see the Repair Install at bottom:Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model. Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.

For best performance I would use 64-bit for 4gb or more RAM, 32-bit (x86) for 3gb or less RAM. You are entitled to use either bit version with each Windows license.\u00a0 The new modern UEFI BIOS replacement requires 64 bit media - you can check BIOS mode in System Information or by presence of EFI System partition in Disk Management.\u00a0 (To find a location type it into the Search box on Task Bar).If your files are not organized now is a good time to sort them into the User folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Music, Downloads, etc. )for yournamed User account using one of The many ways to copy, move, or delete multiple files.\u00a0 I find\u00a0 the easiest way to do this is to browse on the left-hand Explorer bar to C:\\Users\\[Your User Account] to expand User folders, then in right hand pane browse to all locations with unsorted files and drag or copy them separately or in groups to the desired User folder on Explorer bar.\u00a0 Finally, delete unwanted files from each User folder.For all browsers other than Internet Explorer which stores Favorites in the User folder of that name, exportyour bookmarks to Documents now.\u00a0 Most browsers will also let you set up a sync to store your browser settings, Favorites and history in a Google account, Firefox Sync, or similar:Import or export bookmarks - Chrome HelpSync Chrome data across devicesExport Firefox bookmarks to an HTML file to back up or transfer bookmarksHow do I set up Sync on my computer? | FirefoxIn Edge export Favorites as an HTML file to your backup at Settings > Import from another Brower > Export to file.\u00a0 Another method even if Edge won't open is to installManage Edge Favorites to export as .html to Documents on the Data tab.\u00a0 This little app also gives fuller Favorites management like IE's.If your email is stored on your computer, Google how to back up specific mail and account settingsto get solutions like Backup and Restore all Outlook data\u00a0and How do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail? - Microsoft Windows Help.

The difference is that Backup does a scheduled backup of files and System Image, while File History additionally keeps past versions of files.\u00a0 But there can be problems with automated backup during Windows 10 Setup so do yourself a favor and also drag your User folders and any other files you want saved to external or another hard drive, USB flash stick, OneDrive, DVD or CD before reinstalling.\u00a0 Most importantly don't accidentally set up File History on the new install (wiping out your files) before recovering your files as shown here:How to correctly use File History to transfer data files to a new Windows 10 installation - TechRepublicYou can Rescue Files when Windows Won't Startfrom booted Windows installation media,\u00a0System Repair Diskor Recovery drive to another hard drive or USB device.\u00a0If you have a Factory Recovery partition it may not run after Clean Install.\u00a0 You may want to makeyour Recovery Disks so you have a path back to factory condition, following the steps given inyour PC's setup literature or in the Manual located on the Support Downloads webpage foryour model computer. As an alternative to Recovery Disks you can save a WindowsSystem Image Backup\u00a0or more flexible freeMacrium Reflect imageof your old install.\u00a0 Windows imaging requires restoring to the exact same offset (partition position) while Macrium allows restoring it anywhere.\u00a0A Factory install may have the Product Key embedded in BIOS as with Windows 8\/8.1 and will reactivate itself after install.\u00a0 An embedded key should not need to be provided during install, but can beconfirmed by ProduKey which will list it under BIOS-OEM key.\u00a0 You can also retrieve a Retail Product key with this toolprior to reinstall if you've misplaced it's documentation.Check if there is a newer BIOS\/UEFI firmware Update on the PC or Motherboard Support Downloads webpage, then follow install steps in the instructions or download's ReadMe file closely.\u00a0 If in doubt ask for help from your manufacturer's Support, or in a thread here with make\/model in title to attract those who know.\u00a0 Most important is to guard against any power cut during the update which reimages the BIOS\/UEFI chip on motherboard.\u00a0Gather your program installers.For those lacking reinstall media for programs, you may find them on the program'sSupport Downloads webpage.\u00a0 Favorite pre-installed apps may be found on the Downloadswebpage for your model computer or manufacturer-provided Apps Disk. Others may be found by googling or asking back here.\u00a0 Some pre-installed apps may not be available for clean reinstall, but this is a good thing because factory bloatware diminishes performance so re-importing too much of it defeats the purpose of a Clean Install.\u00a0I would only ever install the programs you need and use, preserve their installation media and Product Keys.\u00a0 A good start to audit your present install's software, hardware and Product Keys is to runBelarc Advisor. If needed Office reinstallation media can be obtained viaManage, Download, Backup, & Restore Microsoft Office Products\u00a0and activated with the Product Key you originally bought with it or audited usingBelarc Advisor orProduKey.\u00a0 A good free compatible alternative to Office isLibreOffice Free Office Suite or OpenOffice.\u00a0 You can also Try Office 365 for free to trial the new subscription Office suite fully integrated into the cloud.Many of the favorite apps needed and desired for reinstall are available in the free appNinite - Install or Update Multiple Apps at Once.\u00a0This makes a custom installer you can savewhich keeps all app installers updated within.Just in case, save in advance your Wireless or Ethernet(wired) LAN driver in your backup so ifit isn't provided during install you can install it to get online quickly to install allWindows Updates - which will also provide and update drivers. Your network LAN driver canbe found on the Support Downloads webpage for your model PC or device. The exact make\/model willbe listed in your Device Manager under Network Adapters.Installing the ISOUnplug all other HD's and peripherals except ethernet cable to increase chances of startingup connected after install.\u00a0 If not prompted for a wireless key during install it's likely you'll needto install the wireless driver immediately after getting to the desktop, or if ethernet LAN isworking you can wait for wireless driver to come in via Windows Update or import from PC or adapter maker's Support Downloads webpage.Boot the WIndows 10 installation media by powering up PC while pressing the PC's one-timeBIOS Boot Menu Key. \u00a0 If you see a UEFI version of the bootable flash stick or DVD then choose that, as you have the modern UEFI BIOS which is more secure and stable and offers mouse support. An example of the difference is shown here:Legend: Each Boot Menu is slightly different. Above shows Windows Boot Manager which should appear as first boot device after a UEFI install.\u00a0 P5 can be intuited as the DVD drive, while P1 is a Seagate Hard Drive - which can be determined by googling serial. The Kingston flash sticks are available to choose for UEFI install\/repair (preferred) or Legacy if one has set BIOS to Compatibility (CSM) mode and seeks older Legacy Install without the newer features.\u00a0 The last listing is to Enter the UEFI firmware or BIOS setup to check over settings if needed, which may have a separate Key to Press to Access BIOS\u00a0or be entered via Settings>Update and Security>Recovery>Advanced Startup.A UEFI install requires booting the installation media as a UEFI device, deleting all partitions to clear formatting.\u00a0You may need to turn off Fast Boot in UEFI Firmware to boot UEFI installation media viaBIOS Boot Menu Key lest it bypass key.\u00a0 A UEFI install should configure Windows Boot Manager as permanent first device in Boot Priority.\u00a0For Legacy BIOS keep the hard drive set as first boot device, and use only theBIOS Boot Menu Key to boot media or another drive.\u00a0 This avoids flash media restarting install when PC is rebooted during installation.\u00a0 \u00a0If Windows 8 or 10 will still boot you may alternatively need to access UEFI media or firmware from within Windows Recovery Settings as explained inWhat You Need to Know About Using UEFI Instead of the BIOS.Next insert the Product Key from retail packaging if you have one.\u00a0 For reinstalling Upgrade or Factory install skip the Product Key by clicking link similar to the one shown below. \u00a0 If this option does not appear it means an older or wrong version media is being used so make the latest from Media Creation Tool.\u00a0 It will reactivate once you connect to the internet.Choose Custom Install, thento get it cleanest at the \"Where do you want to install Windows?\" screen(shown below) highlight each partition to select Delete.\u00a0 None of these partitions will be needed in a fresh install and may interfere or build up a disk junkyard if left undeleted.\u00a0(Note:\u00a0 If you did not rescue files stranded in C using the bootable media step earlier, you can save them here.\u00a0 Instead of deleting partitions, just click on C and choose Next withoutdeleting or formatting.\u00a0 This will archive your files in C:\\windows.old.\u00a0 But it is not as clean of an install.)After deleting all partitions it should look like this:Then either select the New button to create and format your partitions as you please, or just click Next to let the installer auto-create\/format only the necessary partitions and begin install - which makes it foolproof.\u00a0If you create new partition(s) to format yourself, after selecting the size (in MB) you want for C, it will create small System partitions in addition to the actual Windows install partition C.\u00a0 Leave these alone and choose the first large partition for the install.\u00a0 In the first partitioning screenshot above you'll see a typical UEFI partition structure created for Windows 10 install.\u00a0 The Recovery partition contains the bootable Repair console that in previous Windows was located on C, the EFI System partition contains the boot files, while the (hidden) MSR partition reserves 128mb for possible System use going forward.\u00a0 The fourth partition will be C: and is where Windows should be installed.\u00a0 If you want you can select a size for C: (a popular size is 100gb) that will leave Unallocated Space after it for Data or other partition(s} for your use - you can format both now or this can also be done later in Disk Management followingCreate and format a hard disk partition - Windows Help.\u00a0 Legacy BIOS' MBR installs only create a 100mb System Reserved in addition to C partition.\u00a0Whether to create additional partitions depends largely if you want your data in the Cpartition with Windows and programs, or have it linked from another partition to make the C partition backup image smaller for easier storage. This way if Windows 10 becomes irreparable you can re-image the OS\/Programs to C and thedata will be current and waiting safely in its own partitionas long as it remains untouched.\u00a0 Programs however should optimally remain on C as most become integrated into Windows until individually uninstalled.\u00a0Edit 10\/2019 During install you can create no longer create a Local Account, but must create or use a Microsoft Account.\u00a0 Make sure this is an account you can receive a Security code from, but after install if you really don't want a MS account you can change it to a Local Account in Windows Settings > Accounts > Your Info > Sign in with a Local Account instead.\u00a0After using Windows 10 for several years I do recommend signing in with a Microsoft Account for fullest functionality, later in Account settings replacing the password with a short PIN for convenience.\u00a0 I also have no privacy concerns or see any performance problems with choosing Express Settings for fullest functionality.\u00a0 Here is a fuller discussion Should you use a local or a Microsoft account in Windows 10? and Customizing Privacy Settings.\u00a0 Later in Account Settings you can add Family members and other people.Expedite Updates and DriversImmediately after install check bottom right System Tray Network icon,\u00a0 connect to your network if necessary.\u00a0If no network connection or networks exist, right click the icon to Troubleshoot Problems.\u00a0You may need to install your network driver saved earlier in backup\u00a0to get online.\u00a0Why can't I connect to a network? - Windows HelpTurn On System Restore in Windows 10:\u00a0 Make sure System Restore is always turned on for C drive and has plenty of disk space apportioned, as this will be your first line of defense and allow you to roll back any undesired changes that affect performance.\u00a0If Windows won't start you can System Restore or do other Repairs from Advanced Startup Options including the booted media or Recovery Drive. Once online type \"Update\" in Start Search box, choose Check for Updates, expedite the install (including Restart ASAP if necessary) of all Updates including Recommended -which may lag for several days if not expedited.\u00a0This is how Windows 10 also delivers newer drivers.\u00a0After restart go back to Check for Updates again until no more are offered.\u00a0Next right click the Start button to choose from Power User menu the Device Manager.:Any drivers still missing or in error (with a !) in Device Manager after all Updates are installed can be found on theSupport Downloads webpage for the model PC or device, along with other OEM software whichyou can wait to see if you really need.Over time I'd compare drivers in Device Manager with those available on the PC or Device's Support Downloads webpage to install any newer drivers found.\u00a0If you installa driver and it performs badly you can Roll Back on its Driver tab in Device Manager.Microsoft Display driver is a placeholder driver which only should be used when no otherpossible driver will install as it will not allow Sleep or Hibernate. So if Updates don't provide abetter driver, import it from the PC model's Support Downloads webpage \u2013 starting with Windows 10, 8.1, 7 driver, if necessary installed inCompatibility Mode.\u00a0If this fails check the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage to let it scan for the needed download to install.\u00a0Unknown Devices are often card reader drivers posted on the PC model's Support Downloadswebpage along with other drivers which may be revealed by a function still missing on the PCsuch as laptop function keys or keyboard lighting, or can be traced usingDevice Manager - Finding Unknown Devices.Co-processor, SM Bus controller, USB and Storage controllers are often elements of thechipset.\u00a0 If no chipset is posted on your PC or motherboard model's Downloads page, useIntel Driver Update Utility,Automatically Detect NVIDIA Products\u00a0or\u00a0 AMD Auto-Detect\u00a0 to find your chipset and\/or Display driver, or ask in our Installation forum.You can also trace any missing driver using\u00a0Hardware Identification.\u00a0It's often faster to googlethe Driver's Details tab Hardware ID (from dropdown menu) than to look it up - seeUpdating a driverwhich covers this thoroughly.\u00a0 In the results be careful to screen out tricky driver finder ads in favor of actual driver downloads.\u00a0If you need help finding a driver, you can ask back here or start a thread here with descriptive title for broader attention.I would not re-import any Factory OEM software until you run for awhile to know for sure youneed it. There may be patches on the PC's Support Downloads webpage needed to improveperformance so browse them to be aware what's available as you test performance to decide ifthey're needed. But keep in mind re-installing OEM bloatware besides that which is absolutelyneeded for good performance or a specific function you want and need defeats the purpose of a CleanReinstall.\u00a0 In general factory utilities duplicate and interfere with\u00a0better versions built into Windows.\u00a0 Exceptions include any battery management or drive locking software for laptops if these provide safety or monitoring functions beyond what Windows offers.\u00a0 I always ask Google about each bloatware to see what it does but it really has to sell me to allow it.\u00a0 Another good resource isShould I Remove It?
