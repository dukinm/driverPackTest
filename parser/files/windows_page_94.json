During this amount of time, laptop batteries deplete and do not hold charge well anymore. This is why there is not much time between the warning and the actual shut down of the computer. If you can find a new compatible battery, this would be one way to help. Another option is to keep the wall power adapter plugged in constantly if possible.I hope this has helped you.

While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers. 2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/57567-resto... 3) Next try these checklists: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402699... https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/443702\/how-to-fix-sou...4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps. If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby.5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button > Settings>Update & Security>Troubleshoot.6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.

Virtually nothing has changed hardware wise between Windows 7 and Windows 10.\u00a0 This is a custom built workstation PC for my home.\u00a0 I stopped using Windows 10 and went back to Windows 7 because of these random freezes.\u00a0 But now with Windows 7 support ending, I am forced to try to solve it.\u00a0 \u00a0I'm not overclocking or doing anything abnormal with my system\/setup.\u00a0The freezes happen completely randomly, sometimes when I'm just resizing a file explorer window, other times when I'm doing more intense work.\u00a0 The computer always freezes up 100% and I'm not able to move the mouse or do anything. The screen just pauses with everything still visible but I\"m not able to interact with it.\u00a0 I've tried leaving it alone for hours to see if Windows will come out of it or give a blue screen, but that never happens.\u00a0 I have to hold down the power button to reset it.\u00a0 When the freeze does happen my audio seems to freak out and just start stuttering until I reboot.\u00a0 Other than that it's a regular good ol' fashioned freeze.\u00a0 There are never any crash dump files or anything in the logs that help.\u00a099% of the time I just get a hard freeze but every one in awhile I will get a freeze and then a blue screen that will stay at \"0% complete\" no matter how long I leave it. The three error codes I've seen from this are \"MACHINE_CHECK_EXCEPTION\", \"CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT\" and \"NMI_HARDWARE_FAILURE\".\u00a0 But I never saw any blue screens or freezes with windows 7 and the same exact hardware.\u00a0Sometimes I can go days without any crash doing the same exact things that made it crash previously, other times it will crash multiple times a day.

There's no System partition on C so it can't convert to GPT because a UEFI install requires that 100mb EFI System partition.There should be a System Active flag on the partition that's actually booting C, so it may be the partition at the right end of the C drive which is marked Active but not System. If so then the converter is probably ignoring it because it lacks the necessary System flag. But it could also be the Active partition on the last disk which looks like a 32gb flash stick was intended to be created by Media Creation Tool from the front end of a 2tb hard drive, then the rest was formatted as a Data partition later.
