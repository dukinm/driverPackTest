The SFC scan should take a couple of minutes. Just wait and avoid interrupting it.

If they were already plugged in, they will keep working provided I don't try to plug them out and back in.When this starts occurring, shutting down my PC no longer \"works\", as in, the Power icon on the tower never shuts off, I need to force shut it down by holding the button down for a few seconds.

I get an error on it in Hardware Manager and it's a 50\/50 toss whether I can restart it or be forced to reboot the computer to fix it since attempting it might freeze the Hardware Manager. I have a 3 monitor setup where the 3rd screen is my living room TV I sometimes use to listen to videos in the living room. When this problem occurs, I can no longer transfer the Audio to this monitor since it doesn't exist in the list of available outputs anymore.- I can no longer start games on Steam.- I can encounter issues with going full screen when watching video content, either streaming or local videos where the image will freeze up for a few seconds whenever I go in or out of full screen.What I've tried:- Going through\u00a0https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/817900\/usb-port-may-stop-working-after-you-remove-or-insert-a-usb-device\u00a0while the problem was occurring.Method 1 scans for changes infinitely.Method 3 froze the Device Manager.The \"Workaround\" I didn't attempt since I don't have a registry entry called \"USB\", there are several USB entries so I didn't dare touch this.Furthermore, I did find the advanced setting in my Control Panel's Power Settings about\u00a0Selective Suspend and it was already set to Disabled.- Complete computer shut down ( shutting down, unplugging EVERYTHING and holding the power button for a minute before replugging everything in)- Selective testing of USB devices to see if one of them was causing the issue: I'm not entirely through this one, but I feel like unplugging my external SSD drive actually did delay the problem occurring, however it did still happen eventually.
