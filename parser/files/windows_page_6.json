Is there a product CD that will reinstall the missing OP files without having to uninstall everything and reinstall? This may seem a silly question but have you installed the Printers Drivers ???Follow the instructions as per printer set up.Usually the printer drivers will install what is required.Check your Device Manager to see if there is a issue with your Universal Serial Bus controllers.\u00a0","Unfortunately, I get just so far into the printer download of drivers installation process and I get the message that the following files are missing - c:\\windows\\inf\\usb.inf, windows\\inf\\ntprint.inf, windows\\inf\\usbprint.inf, windows\\inf\\usbstor.inf - and the installation stops.\u00a0 I've gone to HP Support - they want lots of money to \"fix the files\".\u00a0 This is a new printer, the computer itself is not new but other than the old printer stop working, the computer is fine.\u00a0 Yes, from what I can see, there is a problem with the USB controllers, but how do I fix that problem? This is so maddening!"]},{"symptom":"Win10 BSOD Randomly whilst watching YouTube        Recently I was just chilling watching YouTube and for some unknown reason I got a BSOD; I was only watching YT and wasn't doing anything demanding with my PC.MSInfo32: MSInfo32.zipMinidumps: Minidumps.zipMinidumps_02: Minidumps_02","solutions":["Hi darylt77 I am sorry, can you try uploading those minidump files that link is not coming through . . .Open Windows File Explorer Navigate to C:\\Windows\\Minidump Copy any minidump files onto your Desktop, then zip those up Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.), then choose to share those and get a share linkThen post the link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .","The links need to be clicked on and then select download; it uses end-to-end encryption so if you are right clicking on the link and using \"Save As Link\" it wont work."]},{"symptom":"Error: Something went wrong when installing State of Decay 2 from Microsoft Store        I purchased SoD2 UD for a friend.He tried installing it and got the \"something wrong on our end\" message.We waited a day, same error.We waited a couple of days, same error.We then found a healthy list of things to try, no love.We got the idea of booting into safe mode as we were finding apps active that were stopping us from completing one of the indicated steps.\u00a0 Now he can't log on to the MS Store at all!Please help.***Original title: Can't install SoD2, can't log in while in safe mode, only error is \"something went wrong on our end.\"***","solutions":["Hi,\u00a0Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.\u00a0I understand that you are facing issues while installing State of Decay 2 game on your friends PC.
