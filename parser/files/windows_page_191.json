A while back I redeemed my mojang Windows 10 Edition code after I learned that I got Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition for free since I bought the game like way back around 2012-2013. I played it for a little while and decided to go back to playing Java like normal. Now today I've decided to pick it back up again so I could play crossplatform via xbox with my kid nephew. When I search for Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition in the Microsoft store it tells me that I have to buy the game.
