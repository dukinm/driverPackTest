I'm an Independent Advisor and a Microsoft user like you. Please allow me to assist with your questions.I'm assuming you are referring to the metrics being display under Performance Tab of Task Manager.1. These usages and graphs are pertaining to current utilization level of those resources.CPU: Based on % utilization, it means how much processing power of CPU is being consumed by one or more active processes to run instructions.RAM: The same applies here (utlization level) and it means the more processes are running on the system, more memory is consumed. When there is insufficient hardware memory, Windows will temporarily page data to Paging pool (Paging file is stored on disk) from memory. Disk: This section refers to the Active Time of the disk, not free disk space. So when this is high or full, it means the disk is actively reading from and\/or writing to.In terms of relationship, when a process is launch or working, it may Read\/Write to the disk, temporary store working data on the RAM and instructions runs on CPU (for example to process data).I would suggest reading these post for further details\/information: https:\/\/techcommunity.microsoft.com\/t5\/ask-the-...https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/help\/2160852\/2. Basically CPU would be used to run instructions (like process data) and such data is primarily stored on your hard disks. Depending on how the program is written, it might directly process the data in CPU from Disk hence you will see utilization levels of both CPU and Disk to be high. If the program will read the data from Disk to Memory before processing in CPU, then you will see CPU\/RAM\/Disk to have higher utilization levels.3. RAM usage is dependent on the process(es) and what kind of instructions are being executed. For example, a game requires 1 GB of memory to run, then it would take up at least 1 GB of memory, as more memory will be required to act as temporary storage. Since CPU is used to run instructions so a game will require the CPU to process these data in RAM\/Disk. Together, you can expect all of usage to be increased. If CPU is full, then you can be sure that RAM usage and Disk utilization are probably higher. However, the ratio of increase won't always be the same. I would also suggest reading this article to know more about the relationship between memory and CPU:https:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/busines... I hope these answers you questions.
