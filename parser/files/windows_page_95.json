However, I am experiencing it for the first time after having played the game with no problems for almost an entire year now, since I bought it from the Windows store in October 2018.This is a RECENT issue (game ran successfully last Nov. 16, 2019 - Now it is Nov. 23, 2019, and the game does not launch).I have tried every suggested troubleshooting option listed in (short of reinstalling Windows itself) to make the game even BOOT properly, and nothing has worked.This is CLEARLY an OLD ERROR that is now RESURFACING for users that never had it before. The game DOES NOT LAUNCH.Everything I've read regarding this issue involves access errors, permissions, and verification - all Windows related issues.My version of Windows 10 is UP TO DATE. According to the Microsoft Store, my version of the GAME IS UP TO DATE. My Nvidia DRIVERS ARE UP TO DATE. I have not installed any new software since the game last ran, or changed any firewall, anti-virus, or Windows settings that would affect the game from launching.
