This is my main work computer, which was working great until this Windows update - I desperately need it back up and running ASAP!!Thank you","Microsoft must release a fix for this problem. None of the proposed solutions work and \"clean install\" is not a proper solution.","Any other suggestions? This is my main work computer, which was working great until this Windows update - I desperately need it back up and running ASAP!!Thank youYour files are in the disk and you can copy them. Download Xubuntu ( www.xubuntu.org ), create a USB stick a do a live boot (option \"try before installing\"). Mount the partition (just click twice on the partition icon that you'll find on the desktop) and copy your files to an external disk. Unfortunately, I haven't found a solution to this issue - most things we find are copy and paste of the same information about bootrec and etc.","Updated this morning before going to work now this is happening to my pc as well.... why is an UPDATE causing my pc to become useless???? Fix this microsoft!!! Now!!!","Did you fix it? Same problem after update..","Yes, I let it do its automatic repair. Re-downloaded the update and restarted the pc (didnt shut it down after update) and it worked. Must be something to do with updating and shuting it down.","Automatic repair continues to fail for me.\u00a0 I just got this pc on the 18th, some graphics glitches and software conflicts between windows and AMD.

Say Windows 11 or later? Or will it be Win10 with version patches?        Just wondering if there will be another Windows- I keep reading it will only be Windows 10 with version patches.","solutions":["Hi Angela Sadly, Windows 11 is an Internet myth, there will be no Windows 11 When support for Windows 8 ends, Microsoft will re-brand Windows 10 to just WindowsThe model Microsoft are using going forward is, twice yearly a new version of Windows (called a Feature Update) will be released. That feature update will include any new Functionality and features available for Windows and will deprecate older featuresThat way, once your PC is up to date, you will always have the latest version of Windows. This is something like the Office 365 model, with the one exception, Windows 10 feature updates are free and there is no subscription .","Sadly, Windows 11 is an Internet myth, there will be no Windows 11\u00a0'Sadly' - I wonder why.The newest version of Windows is called Windows 10 v.1909. You can call that Windows 11 if you prefer. Doesn't change anything.The next version of Windows will likely be Windows 10 v.2003 if it isn't called Windows 10 20H1. May as well call that Windows 12. All the same.They're just names."]},{"symptom":"How to reset pin        They are requesting my pin number, don't know it and don't know how to change it.","solutions":["Hi Need Help. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.To set up or change the PIN go into Windows Settings > Sign In Options > Windows Hello PIN.This can be used in place of the password, although the password remains and needs to be remembered since some functions will require it. But on the sign in screen it is faster to use a PIN, the password will still be there under other Sign-in Options.If you cannot Add or Remove the PIN in Settings > Accounts > Sign in Options even after a restart, then unhide Hidden Files in File Explorer > View tab > Options > Folder and Search Options > View tab > tick box to Show hidden Files.Browse to C:\\Windows\\ServiceProfiles\\LocalService\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Ngc Delete or rename to Ngc.old this folder to reset the PIN. **You may need to first take ownership of the folder: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/3841-add-ta... Once you delete or rename the folder it will recreate it so you can add a PIN normally in Sign-In Options.

The messages were about needing to update the password, but I don't use the account anymore and just wanted to delete it.The problem is that I no longer attend that school. My previous password no longer works and trying to change the password just leads to an error message to \"contact the administrator\" but I am no longer affiliated with them and as far as they are concerned, the account doesn't exist.I've tried going into settings. I can still see the account under \"Emails and Accounts.\" When I click \"Manage\" it takes me to a login in screen, but I don't have a functioning password and no longer have access to the administrator for the school account because I am not a student anymore.I've tried deleting the account through every other avenue I could find through google and this is now the only place it appears, but the error messages continue to pop up and they are a nuisance.Is there any way to remove the account from my computer that doesn't require a password? It is not even my primary account, but I can't seem to get rid of it.","solutions":["Hi PC. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Guardian Moderator here to help you.One fix that works when a Settings > Accounts > Email and Accounts listing has no Remove button is to look below that to School accounts, choose it there and Remove or Disconnect it. Then the Remove button should appear above.You must also be doing this from an Administrator account. Check to be sure at Settings > Accounts > Your Info.I hope this helps.
