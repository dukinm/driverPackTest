Is that not an option anywhere?","Hello ThagstromDon't know how I missed this, but here is the boot order https:\/\/autode.sk\/2R4EQBlClearly the primary SSD M2 drive is the principle boot device.The laptop does boot up fine with the second SSD installed and even gets as far as loading Windows, it just BSODs within a few seconds of finishing the load.\u00a0 So it is not possible to interrogate the second SSD.I don't believe it is possible to access the second drive from the bios.Is there any other way I can check the status of the second drive?\u00a0 I do not have any other ZBooks that I can trial it in unfortunately.Thanks againPhil","If you boot from Windows 10 install media can you check to see if there are any partitions left on the second SSD. After USB boot select Install now > Language and then Custom install. See if it shows partitions still on Disk 1. I would think Disk 0 would be the working SSD. But you need to be sure before you delete anything.","Hello NeilpzzWithout the second SSD, the machine boots up fine.This is the disk management detail without the second drive installed\u00a0https:\/\/autode.sk\/36HoMfy.Does this all look in order?ThanksPhil","Yes but you should boot from install media with both drives connected to see if there is a partition left on the second drive.","Hi NeilpxxThanks for the input.Unfortunately I have run into issues!!I created Windows 10 Installation USB drive.Attempted the process on another (less valuable) laptop and managed to access the drive\/partition info on that device.So I then tried the same on the Z book.To allow booting from USB drive, it was necessary to enable legacy boot option.I did that and saved the BIOS setting (a number was required to be input at this point which was displayed on screen).When I rebooted the device, I got a Bit Locker number entry request.\u00a0 Now Bit Locker is enabled across the business unit (by corporate IT), but checking in AD Manager, it was showing disabled against the machine I have been working on.So I went back into the BIOS and reset the legacy boot option to disabled.\u00a0 Fortunately, when I restarted the laptop, the Bit Locker trap did not re-appear.Given the value of this device, I am inclined to leave this for another day rather than brick the machine and make it useless.Thanks to you and Thagstrom, but I need to put this down for a while.I expect that the primary SSD will be sufficient for the user, the additional drive was a \"nice to have\".Phil"]},{"symptom":"I want windows 7 to not end support?

Razer orbweaver stealth was not letting my pc sleep, screen saver and screen timer work. Hope this helps..Since I started using Windows 10 my computer will not go into sleep mode and my screen saver mode will not come on.This happens due to a compatibility issues between Joystick devices and Windows 10. To avoid this please disable the game controller device under Device Manager >> Human Interface Device >> HID-compliant Game Controller. However, do note that when you disable the game controller, you might lose virtual joystick related features in Synapse.","Same here, with Logitech Extreme 3D Pro joystick. Installing the most recent drivers, from the manufacturer's site, did no good obviously, since multiple brands of joysticks and controllers, and thus drivers, are exhibiting the same problem.On a side note, I noticed that when rebooting with the joystick plugged in, the OS refuses to see the joystick. Go into Control Panel, and it is not in the Devices lineup. Triggering the search for new hardware will not find it. You must unplug the joystick, and then plug it back in again, to get the OS to register its presence.My point being that while plugged in, in either state (recognized by the OS or not), it causes the monitor to never go into sleep mode, and the system will never go into hibernate mode. Unplug the joystick, and leave it that way, and all is good (even without a reboot), with sleep & hibernate.","Thank you so much!I knew it was something to do with my razer keybaord \/ mouse but your solution to disable HID-compliant Game Controller was brilliant!So brilliant it's actually the first time I reply on posts like yours :)","I had this issue as well and found a fix.\u00a0While the unplugging the game controllers did resolve the issue, I encountered an issue with my all my USB devices other than my keyboard were running sluggishly and any new USB device I plugged in wasn't recognized by Windows 10.\u00a0After a reboot I disabled USB selective suspend setting and now I am this issue is completely resolved without the need to plug in and remove game controllers when I am done.The setting can be found at the path below.Start > Settings > Power & Sleep > Additional Power Settings > Change Plan Settings > Change Advanced Power Settings > USB Settings > USB Selective Suspend Setting > Set to DisabledHopefully, this works for all of you as well!"]}]}
