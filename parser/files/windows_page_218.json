Windows 10 had recently force-updated to the latest build, as it tends to do, and I noticed that my desktop was running significantly slower as a result of the latest installation. I decided to wait a few days, because I wasn't really keen on rolling back the update. Turns out nothing changed speed-wise, so I decided to use the windows 10 feature that allows you to roll back the latest update. I was assured, during the process, that local files wouldn't be affected. Unfortunately, I've discovered that local game saves for the game Minecraft were rolled back in addition.I'm not sure if I misread something but, like I said, I was under the impression that local files weren't supposed to be affected. Additionally, the rollback on the game save seems to be mush further than the point at which the update was installed. More specifically, the save file was rolled back to a point in time that notably predates the installation of the problematic update.Aside from having a recovery point, because I didn't make one before I rolled back the update, is there any way to remedy this situation? Can I undo the undo, so to speak?","solutions":["Hi my name is Ross, I'm an independent advisor.
