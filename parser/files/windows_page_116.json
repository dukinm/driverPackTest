We often find out later that the fix was the skipped step. If you need help performing any step I will help.The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is how to keep the latest manufacturer's drivers current. Windows Update drivers are never enough. I wrote these steps out for you once, but I will repeat them in hopes you'll understand the process better.Go to the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model or Dell Service tag on sticker, download and install the latest Display driver for your display device, comparing it with the one presently showing in the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. While there check that you also have the latest chipset, BIOS, network, bluetooth, USB and all other drivers, compared to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.Take your time, these drivers are absolutely critical to the PC functioning properly.If the Display driver doesn't fix the missing feature then I would run the Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool from this linkhttp:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m..., choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now. This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method. It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.Keep me posted on your progress as I will be here to help until the case is resolved."]},{"symptom":"\"Cortana & Search settings\" not showing up in windows search        I am trying to disable bing results when I search using the windows 10 search bar.

Ok so I was being really dumb and tried to store the files stored on my Desktop in my D drive but everything got all jumbled and I did not get the desired result. I have tried restoring the default location on my Desktop which is now stated to be my D drive, but I get an error stating \"failed to build the list of regular subdirectories under D:\/System Volume Information.\"If I could be helped asap I would much appreciate it, thanks.","solutions":["Hi GW. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Did you move the Desktop to D without creating a Desktop folder there first, so it mixed your desktop files in with all the D drive files? This is a common error. If it's a separate hard drive there is some risk of fatal startup errors when moving Desktop folder off of the same hard drive. But I'll help you correct it now before it's too late.Follow whichever option works here to restore the Default Desktop folder location here:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/23504-resto...DO NOT copy the files back if it prompts you in Option One to do this or it will copy all of the D drive files. Wait until after it moves the Desktop folder back to C, then manually copy the actual Desktop files from D to C.If Desktop cannot be moved from the Location tab Reset Default Location button, then Option Two tells how to recreate the shell User Desktop folder from scratch. This will always work, so there is no need to panic. Be patient and follow the instructions precisely.In the future when you move User shell folders off of C, be sure to create the same folder in the target location first, or when it asks you if you want it to do this for you.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.
