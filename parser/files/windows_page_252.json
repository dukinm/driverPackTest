You have no idea how good those drivers are, whether they are infected with malware, etc. You should get drivers only only from the manufacturers of the hardware.You should cancel your subscription immediately.One other point: I don't recommend getting a new driver just because a new one is available.Although a driver upgrade normally goes well, it is not without danger.

I am not having any problems per say however I would feel a whole lot better running a clean install over and above an upgrade.When I clean installed Windows 8.1 x64 on my G73JH-A1 using my USB Flash Drive, I never ran into any issues.Any help for this issue clean installing Windows 10 using my USB Flash Drive would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.","solutions":["I had this problem too, and tried many times without luck. Finally, I found this answer from 2011:http:\/\/superuser.com\/questions\/279359\/windows-7-fresh-install-missing-cd-dvd-media-driversIf you are installing with USB drive, when it asks for driver, click Cancel.

However, after a period of a few hours to a few days, the shortcut disappears from Quick Access. It can be manually re-added but always disappears shortly thereafter.\u00a0I performed a fresh install of Windows on a new machine and encounter the same thing there. I also have Google Drive File Stream installed, which is linked to a separate Google account. The Google Drive File Stream root folder is also pinned to Quick Access but does not disappear as the Google Drive folder (from Backup and Sync) does.\u00a0I am able to successfully pin folders within Google Drive to Quick Access (for example, the \"Projects\" folder found at Google Drive > Documents > Projects) and these folders do not disappear from Quick Access; it is only the root Google Drive folder that exhibits this problem.\u00a0I only have one user account on my machines.\u00a0How can I ensure the root Google Drive folder stays in the Quick Access list?\u00a0","solutions":["I've discovered that this is only happening to me when I have both Google Backup and Sync and Google Drive File Stream installed.

I'll try and help you solve this problem.This often means there's a problem with the password you're using for the account or your email account has been blocked for some reason by the provider.I'm assuming you're getting this \"Attention\" message from the Mail app - it's sometimes hard to tell from the information shown there exactly what the problem is.A good way to confirm your email account details are working is to try and login to your email providers webmail directly - if that works you know everything is ok. If you can't login that way your provider will have a \"reset password\" type process you can follow to get back on track. So for example if the email address you are having trouble with ends with @outlook.com I would suggest visitinghttps:\/\/www.outlook.com and attempting to login using your details. Similarly if it ends @gmail.com you would visithttps:\/\/gmail.com, etc. Once you've confirmed, or reset, the password I'd return to the Mail app and attempt to reenter the verified details again.Regards, David","David,I have Windows 10 Pro.\u00a0 I am constantly, as in two or three times a day, getting the message that my accounts are messed up and I need to fix something.\u00a0 I click on the link, it takes me to the Email & Accounts and gives me the option to put in my passcode.\u00a0 I do that and it tells me that everything is fine now.\u00a0 But then, later on, it goes back through the same process.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen comments about this on other posts...and they lead me to this comment\/question.\u00a0 One of them talks about if your email address or addresses showing up in the \"Accounts used by other apps\" section, that I should delete them.\u00a0 Is that correct?\u00a0 \u00a0 I am currently showing two different Microsoft account\u00a0email addresses under that heading.\u00a0 Should I delete one or possibly both of those?
