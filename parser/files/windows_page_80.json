The Troubleshooter ran only steps that I had already tried. All printers, including built-in ones, are similarly affected. I can access the print queue in other ways (i.e., from Print Manager). Only when I try to access it through the Settings menu, is it not working. I think perhaps the glitch is occurring in that menu. I'm not optimistic, but I hadn't yet tried starting in Safe Mode. That may be a useful suggestion for narrowing down the cause.Your reply also gave me another idea. The laptop belongs to our organization. Thus far I have tried to investigate the problem from the user's account, running apps as administrator only when prompted. I will need to try restarting the laptop from my account and see if the problem is present when the Settings menu is run from an administrator account. That may narrow down the scope of the problem.Thanks again,Barry","Hi, Hopefully it works for you, have a great day Regards","Hi Charles,Way too many distracting elements to this story! The direct copy function on the multifunction machine in question is producing copies in which the black is way too light if requesting a color copy, but look just fine if a black & white copy is requested. Printing and scanning work fine in either mode. For a while, it was not visible from computers that were accessing the network through the WiFi, although it was working just fine if the computer was using a wired connection. Both the printer and router were showing that it was being assigned an IP address. I finally diagnosed and fixed that problem by restarting the router. I'm hoping that pushing a firmware update will fix the copy function, but when I attempt to do that, I get the message that the firmware is current and no update is needed. Eventually I'll find instructions on how to force an update. In the meantime, it's only annoying and frustrating.My apologies, because none of the above information is really relevant to this forum. It does, however, illustrate the number of apparently unrelated and frustrating glitches related to printing that we experienced almost simultaneously.Thanks,Barry\u00a0","Hello Barry!Did you ever find a solution to this issue?
