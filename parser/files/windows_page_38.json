For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/driverview.html  For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.http:\/\/pcsupport.about.com\/od\/driverssupport\/ht\/driverdlmfgr.htm    ====================================================Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in the system behind slower memory.
