I've read about every help pages there is on this topic, but none solved my issue, so here I am.Here's the situation : I just bought a new laptop and I'm trying to transfer my windows 10 pro license from my old laptop to the new one.The old laptop originally came with Windows 10 Home OEM, which I upgraded to Pro using the Microsoft Store Upgrade earlier this year.

I checked disk management and the drive was there but it was showing \"uninitialized\". I try to initialize it and then the drive disappears completely. I have no choice but to take it out of the laptop and connect it as an external, but I only did that after restarting once to see if it would fix the problem, which it didn't. I tried to unlock the drive after restarting, but after unlocking it disappeared again.I looked around online and found the repair-bde solution which is outlined here. Unfortunately, even though the drive shows up for a few seconds, it disappears too quickly afterwards that I can't even use this method. It says something like \"D: is not a volume\".By physically observing the drive, I can see the external's controller led blinking as if it was reading normally, this happens in the first few seconds when I connect it (when the D drive shows up in explorer as a locked drive), but then the led gets constant, and the drive keeps spinning at insane speeds (when this happens the drive disappears completely as if nothing is connected, but it still shows up in \"Safely remove this drive\", but I can't remove it either so I have to forcefully disconnect it).I understand that the drive could've failed beyond repair, but since it is still getting recognized I still have some hope in recovering the data in it, and I want to exhaust all possible options.I also tried a software such as EaseUS for recovery but it keeps \"loading disk information\" forever when the faulty drive is connected.

With older versions of Windows there were restrictions that the OEM software could only be supplied with a new computer - ie. from a manufacturer. The OEM software package had warnings printed on it to this effect, and it was also mentioned in the licensing agreement. The OEM packages no longer have this warning and there is no mention of that previous restriction in the terms I've linked to above.As you're no doubt aware the main difference with an OEM license is is cannot be transferred to a new motherboard (for example if you upgrade again in the future).Regards, David","First of all I would like to thank you for your answer David.If other users are reading this reply I would like to\u00a0point out the importance of difference between OEM and retail as David already spoken briefly about. However this reply and further discussion is going to be about the OEM-license.As you're no doubt aware the main difference with an OEM license is is cannot be transferred to a new motherboard (for example if you upgrade again in the future).Regards, DavidAs far as I know, besides what David mentioned above, these disadvantages also\u00a0occur with an OEM-license (someone can correct me if I'm wrong).Buying a OEM-license only let's you do a clean install of Windows 10 and can not be used to update older versions of Windows.Microsoft is not providing support for OEM-licenses. In case you need help using the operating system or having any problems you won't be able to contact Microsoft support.The answer from your reply brings me to my next question. I've read the following articles to try to gather information but I'm still not sure if this is approved by\u00a0license terms for Windows 10 OEM:https:\/\/www.tomshardware.com\/reviews\/get-windows-10-free-or-cheap,5717.htmlSince it's completely in accordance with\u00a0license terms for Windows 10 OEM to buy a OEM and install on a self built computer, I would like to ask about the price range from different sites online. The aberration of the total price for the operating system is quite high from different sellers,\u00a0re-sellers, online auctions\u00a0and shopping website's online. For example\u00a0an American multinational American e-commerce\u00a0corporation is listing the operating system for as low as 4 USD online while if I would go to the local IT-store in my town they would charge me roughly 190\u00a0USD, both for the Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit OEM-License.The 190 USD version is also sold as OEM and not retail.What's the recommended price from when you are sold a genuine licensed Microsoft Windows 10 OEM? How can I, as a buyer and end consumer, know if my key is not part of a fraud, stolen or non-genuine key?\u00a0As a buyer and consumer (apart from the risk of being scammed of my money) would I in anyway\u00a0violate the Microsoft\u00a0end-user\u00a0license agreement by buying the cheaper version of the operating system for 4 USD instead of 190 USD?Best regards,","The 190USD price is about right, I'm in the UK, I believe that's also about the price you'd pay buying directly from Microsoft.The very cheap offers you mention available online are in many cases illegal - they often turn out to be keys intended for another channel (such as the organisation \"volume licence\", or educational versions). The only real indicator that something might be wrong is that the price is too-good-to-be-true!
