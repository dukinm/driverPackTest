My problem is not WiFi, that works fine. It is not a network issue. When connected by cable or WiFi, everything works as expected. It is not a router issue either.The problem is a piece of hardware - a modem that plugs into a USB port and provides data access via cellular service. AT&T in this case.I have been using Windows since version 3 and am broadly familiar with installing and troubleshooting. I'll walk you through some of my efforts to see if there is something that I missed.Unplug. Re-start. Plug back in. Verify updated drivers. Check network is recognized. Check properties. Uninstall modem software and drivers. Reinstall. Uninstall and install older drivers and software. Confirm correct FW for the modem. Try it on another machine. Try it on a 3rd machine. Install software from manufacturer (Sierra Wireless). Same results, appears connected, recognized, strong signal reception, no data transmitted or received. Uninstalled all associated drivers and supporting software, uninstalled the device, suppressed the embedded installation software in the modem in hopes that windows update would find and load a driver. I also tried switching to airplane mode, then turning that off to act like a switch. That did nothing either. I tried switching from a USB port on the machine to a tethered\/powered USB port. I also tried using the compatibility switch on the driver. As far as the computer knows the device is working. I just can't figure out why it does not xfer data.Ran diagnostics software multiple times. In all cases informed that there are no issues - and yet still cannot access the internet. Got a new SIM card, no change.On the chance the modem itself was failing I tested it on an older laptop with Windows 8.1 installed. And it worked exactly like it is supposed to. The modem itself is fully functional.I think the conclusion is clear. Something in Win 10 build 1909 18363.535 (or more likely a periodic quality updates) might be the problem. As the last time the modem was working was 11 December - the same day that some updates were installed.The modem has good error reporting tools. My problem is I'm not sure what all of it means.One more option I am going to explore is I have another machine with the same Win10 build but has not been updated (or used) in several months. I'll put the modem in that machine and see if the issue replicates.Hopefully this more granular background will give you a better understanding of the problem.","Thanks for clarifying. If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately check for these again and hide with the Hide Updates tool explained here: https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta...

That worked, sort of. There now appeared to be an internet connection indicated, and there was actually data passed (uplink and downlink).
