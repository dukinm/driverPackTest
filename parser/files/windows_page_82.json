So, I don't know if it makes a difference but I have an Alienware desktop and when I pull up the setup utility with F2 it is the \"Aptio Setup Utility.\" For restoring the BIOS\/UEFI settings to default there is an option that says \"Restore Defaults\" on the Exit tab. Is that all I would need to do to restore all of the defaults, or is there another step?As far as the USB itself goes, I unfortunately don't have another computer that I could test it on and make sure it works. I used the Media Creation Tool to format it again this morning to make sure I was working with a fresh install. Whenever I have the USB plugged in and pull up the Boot Options menu with F12 it shows: \"Boot mode is set to: UEFI; Secure boot: ONUEFI OPTIONS:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0HDD2 - Windows Boot Manager (Intel Data_Volume)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0USB1 - UEFI OS(PNY USB Flash Drive 1100) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Onboard NIC (IPV4)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Onboard NIC (IPV6)OTHER OPTIONS:\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0BIOS Setup\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Diagnostics\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0BIOS Flash Update\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Device Configuration\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Peripheral Device Setting (OPROM Setting)\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Change Boot Mode Setting\"From here I have been selecting the USB1 option and pressing enter for it to boot from the USB. However, when I do that it does the exact same thing as when I just regularly boot from the hard drive (the long message that ends with writing segment heap and preparing automatic repair), and it sits there and does that until I turn it off. I have never been able to get to a second screen from the USB boot that shows options to repair my computer.\u00a0\u00a0","What that means is it's bypassing the media (which you appear to be booting correctly and is listed correctly as UEFI media) and attempting to start Windows which is why you're seeing the same thing as starting WIndows, so there must be something wrong with the media. Can you locate another 8gb+ flash stick or new DVD to try creating the media again to see if it works?Sometimes resetting the BIOS to defaults works too. You only need to find the choice to Reset to Defaults, then Save and Exit. Go back to check the Settings for UEFI, Secure Boot, and Fast boot are still enabled, and WIndows Boot Manager is still set first to boot in Boot Priority Order. If there is no WBM choice it will invoke itself during install so just keep the WIndows hard drive set first, trigger the media using BIOS Boot menu as you're correctly doing.","Unfortunately I don't have another USB that would work or a DVD drive to burn a DVD. I might try to use the Media Creation Tool with my USB again, maybe it didn't set it up quite right for some reason.
