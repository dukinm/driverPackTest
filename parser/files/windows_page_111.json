The timers seem to be set by windows itself for maintenance stuff. Im just worried that disabling them could keep my system from updating properly or doing its \u00a0required maintenance. Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks.","solutions":["Hi ArronRest assured you can safely delete those wake timers,, that will have no adverse effects on your PC or its ability to update or run maintenence tasks, that will still happen in the background while you use your PC..."]}]}
