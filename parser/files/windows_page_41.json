Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.After uninstalling antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.If you want the best on-demand scanner download and install Malwarebytes from https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/mwb-download\/ In it's Settings > Protection > Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits. Then on Scan tab choose Threat Scan and Run Scan. Clean up anything found, restart PC and then run again until it comes up clean. If you want to keep Malwarebytes as an on-demand scanner then you can disable its Real Time trial version in it's Settings > Accounts tab.Next check for damaged System Files since the problem anti-viruses can damage WIndows:https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/how-to-use-sfc-scannow...

Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 5) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.6) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...
