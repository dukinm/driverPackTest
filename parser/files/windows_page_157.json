I created a new account with my phone number, but as soon as I logged in it wanted an e-mail, but would not accept my e-mail because it was used on the old account. Can I merge the two accounts?","solutions":["Hi Cecile. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.It sounds like you were unable to add the MS Account when you were setting up Windows. At that point you should have disconnected from the internet which forces it to set up a Local Account, which you can then later convert to your MS Account.I understand you created a new MS account instead using your phone number. It will now not be possible to merge the two because both are being used already for a MS account, and to add an alias to either would need to be a new email or phone number that's not been used as a MS account, then it can be set as Primary. It's also not possible to merge the two due to policies we are trying to get changed but are kept for security reasons.So what I would do is confirm if you can sign in now online to your original MS Account (if that's the one you want to keep) athttps:\/\/login.live.com\/. If not then recover your password or account here:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/12429\/... Once you know you can sign into the intended MS Account, change the temporary account you created with the phone number to the intended MS Account. To do this go into Settings > Accounts > Your info and select Sign in with a Local Account instead. Restart PC.Then go back to the same place where the link will now read Sign in with a MS Account instead so you can link your MS Account properly this time now that you know it's working or recovered.Then I would close the phone number account so you can reclaim the number to add as authentication on your email-based MS Account. To close the account go here:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/227763\/how-to-complet... It should tell you how long you will need to wait to add it to your MS Account as a Security backup here:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/12428\/...This is used in case you lose access to your MS Account or need to recover password. Until that phone number is available, I'd at least add a secondary email address in the same place, or another phone number you have voice or text access to.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

I also checked another printer that I have, and it printed just fine on there.I have no clue why that printer just does not like my laptop, as I have both uninstalled and reinstalled the printer, and nothing has fixed it.If you know what is going on with it, thanks in advance.","solutions":["Hi,\u00a0Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.\u00a0We understand your concern, as you are getting print with the inverted color scheme. .
