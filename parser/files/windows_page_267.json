These have usually been related to the AMD Radeon M9 GPU. This GPU has been a disaster from the beginning, and had been overheating regularly, resulting in system crashes. Attempts to update the AMD drivers resulted in more crashes. So I had disabled the GPU in Windows Device Manager. The result was a more stable computer during regular use. But whenever Windows Home attempted to install an Update, all hell would break loose because the update would crash when it detected the disabled GPU and tried to update the drivers.Using the Microsoft \"SetupDiag\" tool, I was able to determine that the installation for 1903\/1909 was logging an error for a driver update on the Radeon. It was not clear from the SetupDiag log whether this issue was in fact the root cause of the Update\u00a0 crash \/ BSOD, but decided to figure out a way around it and see what happens. I discovered the \"Policy Plus\" tool, which provides Group Policy functions that are not included in Windows 10 Home. I used Policy Plus to edit the system to disable driver updates on the Radeon system devices. A good procedure is here:\u00a0https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/263851\/how-to-prevent-windows-from-automatically-updating-specific-drivers\/I'm pleased to report that I was then able to successfully install the Updates from a USB drive.

In no particular order, they are:1- Too many programs trying to start alongside Windows.One way to begin diagnosing this is to open Task Manager and turn to the Startup tab. Do you need all those programs to start with Windows?2- Malware infectionSome strains of malware will do much of their work as the computer is starting.3- Incorrect configuration changePeople make all kinds of mistakes when they change their computer's settings, usually by following bad advice.

I've attempted using the DirectX installer linked in so many help posts of similar issues, but to no avail.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Are you referring to the Windows 10 Reset shown here: https:\/\/www.zdnet.com\/article\/windows-10-tip-re... \/Reset will frequently fail for various reasons, an alternative is the in-place Repair Install which is an Upgrade over itself that reinstalls Windows while keeping your files, settings and apps in place. You can even customize it to Save Nothing which is the same as a Reset. I will give you steps to both free up space on smaller drives and perform version Updates and Repair Upgrade on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.First here are tips for managing smaller drives including the 32-gb SSD which they should have never allowed Windows 10 be installed upon:https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/askjack\/...https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3040404\/windows...https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/maximize-stora...As more space becomes needed, you can move your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders to another internet hard drive you have or install, or into OneDrive and then set them to On Demand so they reside in the cloud and only have download links on the PC:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/116029-turn...https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3233488\/windows...You can also offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive you can install on the same PC (even in the DVD drive bay) as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/1964-move-u.... I would not move program files or speed will be affected. You could also install a larger SSD\/HDD.This should make enough space to install Windows Updates or even the Reset. But for now I'd focus on the latest Version update since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place.Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator. This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki.... This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive. There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/265054\/how-to-easily-... You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you. There are ways to block Updates here: https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta... If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates. You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.
