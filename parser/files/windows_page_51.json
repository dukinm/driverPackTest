If Windows 7\/8\/10 came preinstalled with the computer, that is called an OEM license. For an OEM license, the license dies as soon as Motherboard dies. So essentially it is non-transferable. If that is the case you need to get a new license.However, this is not same for retail licenses i.e. you purchased the license through Microsoft store. That does carry transfer rights. If that is the case, please see the below steps:Run the activation troubleshooter on the new device using the below steps:Go to Settings>Update and security>Activation and run the troubleshooter. and select I recently changed hardware on this device.(Please note that Activation troubleshooter requires you to have digital license linked to Microsoft Account.)If the troubleshooter hasn't helped, you would have to call Microsoft during support hours to get more help.https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/405170...Please let us know if you need any assistance."]},{"symptom":"Cortana getting dumber?

It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 3) Something you're installing (#1 suspect the 3rd party AV) must be causing this on a Clean install, so either System Restore to right after install and monitor performance after every install and settings change, or do the install over per the above to do this. To try to System Restore to a point right after the install follow this guide:https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/how-use-system-r... 4) You can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...

Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.1) No expert in Forums - where we see the most cases, by the thousands - recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we have solved many problems over the years by having them uninstalled.I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, best Windows performance, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.After uninstalling antivirus in Settings > Apps > Apps & Features, restart the PC, then type Security in Start Search, open Windows Defender Settings, there and in Windows Defender Security Center fix anything that's flagged.If you want the best on-demand scanner download and install Malwarebytes from https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/mwb-download\/ In it's Settings > Protection > Scan Options enable Scan for Rootkits.

I would not move program files or speed will be affected. You could also install a larger SSD\/HDD.This should make enough space to install Windows Updates. But I'd focus on the latest Version update since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.
