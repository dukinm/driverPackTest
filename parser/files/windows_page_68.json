I'm trying to understand how full-disk bitlocker works as I intend deploying it on a number of PCs, not all of which have a TPM. I enabled bitlocker on a windows 10 laptop which does have a TPM but I elected not to use it. Instead, I saved the key to a USB flash drive. My expectation was that if I attempted to reboot the laptop without the flash drive, it would fail but in fact, it boots as normal. I've tried several times, even removing the battery. So does bitlocker give any protection if there is no TPM?","solutions":["Hello Robert,\u00a0Do you remember if you chose\u00a0 to \"Insert a USB flash drive\" for how to unlock your drive at startup like at step 10 in option 1 of the tutorial below?https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/37060-turn-off-bitlocker-operating-system-drive-windows-10-a.htmlIf you didn't, then you can turn off BitLocker for you OS drive using option 2 above, and start over using option 1 above being sure to choose a USB at step 10.","Hi Shawn,Thanks for your reply. I don't actually recall any options being presented before I chose to save the key to the USB drive. I certainly don't remember specifically choosing to have the USB plugged in to unlock the disk. I kind of assumed that as I had saved the key to a USB drive, it would know where to look for it, or at least ask.Remember that I do have a TPM on this PC, I'm just choosing not to use it to see how it works in this situation. So is it possible it has detected the TPM and chosen the 'automatic unlock' option perhaps?\u00a0What I'd really like to understand is the protection the current situation is giving. If the drive is 'automatically unlocked', what is the point of having it encrypted in the first place? I'm sure there is a simple answer to this but trying to find it described anywhere is proving very difficult.Rob.","It is possible. If your PC also has the Device Encryption feature, it would have been used by default.Do you have Windows 10 Home or Pro installed? BitLocker will not be available with Home, but Device Encryption may.If you like, you could turn off BitLocker encryption for the drive, disable the TPM in BIOS, and try encrypting the OS drive again using the steps in the tutorial I posted above to see if you are able to select to unlock at startup with a USB.","The system in question is windows Pro.\u00a0I will certainly try your suggestions. Thanks.I noticed in 'Device Security' it says \"Standard hardware security not supported\". Yet I have the ability to reset and manage the TPM.I'm still struggling to understand the basics. For example, if I have a PC with a TPM but someone steals the module (they are very easy to install and remove) does that mean they will have access to any disk in the system? I'm assume yes and I guess that's the point of having the PIN. Or does the TPM store information about the system that's difficult or impossible to replicate?I'm also rather concerned that I have a system where the bitlocker manager clearly shows bitlocker is enabled but it appears to offer no protection.Rob.\u00a0","The\u00a0\"Standard hardware security not supported\" message could indicate that not all requirements are met. For example, at least TPM 2.0 version.https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/36454-verify-trusted-platform-module-tpm-chip-windows-pc.htmlThe TPM is usually soldered to the motherboard, so they would need to steal the whole computer.I don't like to use \"Let BitLocker automatically unlock my drive\" with TPM, but use a PIN or USB to unlock along with TPM. This way if they steal the PC, they still can't unlock it with the TPM alone.","The TPM is usually soldered to the motherboard, so they would need to steal the whole computer.For laptops yes, but it seems many (most?) motherboards don't come with it as standard and you have to buy the module separately e.g.https:\/\/www.asus.com\/Motherboard-Accessories\/TPM-M-R2-0\/Yes, very worrying that there are so many options for bitlocker with many not providing useful protection, not helped by inadequate documentation.Rob."]},{"symptom":"Windows 10 update November 2019 1909 - Printer issue still not resolved        My printers stopped working after the last Windows 10 update in October 2019.
