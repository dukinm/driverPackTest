The major advantage of doing an upgrade is that you don't have to format your hard drive. The new operating system will simply replace your previous installation, and you'll be able to keep all of your files and programs. This process takes the least amount of time.By performing a clean install of Windows, there are many advantages. Clean install is an opportunity to start fresh from scratch without any trial software that might have come preinstalled with your system. You will also regain control over your apps, as you can now install only the applications you need.\u00a0However, since you are connected to an organizational network, you can get in touch with one of a trusted Microsoft Solution provider for better assistance in upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10.

Now I want to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro with a purchased product key, but each time I try it fails\u00a0 with\u00a00xc004f050 (The product key you entered didn't work)This is my second product key that did not work. Can I upgrade to Windows 10 Pro by using the path above?I searched windows forums and tried googling this issues but I cannot find anything which even comes close.Thanks in advanceRick","solutions":["Hi Rick Yes, the method you mentioned above is correct and should work . . . Where are you obtaining those Windows 10 Pro licence keys, is that from Microsoft or some 3rd party retailer?Are you getting Windows 10 Pro upgrade licence keys or the full Windows 10 Pro licence keys?","The keys were purchased from Newegg.com which I guess is a third-party and the key that I requested was a Windows pro upgrade","Hi Rick It is hard to verify if the licence key is genuine, your best option would be to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to either verify that licence key, or upgrade your system with that key:Choose a local Phone Number: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/13948\/...","I have tried contacting Microsoft support but there\u2019s no way for me at least that I can see is how to do that if you have a link or something I\u2019d really appreciate it","Hi thanks much for your reply. I did contact MS. Apparently the steps to accomplish what I was trying to do isCall MS Customer\u00a0 SupportThey gave me a generic product\u00a0 ID to use. But before you use this ID you have to disconnect your PC from the webOnce off the web.. I used the Product ID which they supplied.Reboot the PCWhile coming up plug your PC back onto the WEBAfter rebooting and after you login to your PC, Winnows will take you to the activate screen. Insert the new Product ID and choose activate.I did find something like this on the web while looking for a solution.. In fact the generic ID is in the solution, the secret they neglected to add was to disconnect your PC from the web.The rep explained that when trying to update the current version to the new version the 2 product keys do not match.. That is why I got the error \"wrong product ID\"Thanks everyone who replied to my post","Hi Rick, I am so glad this is resolved"]},{"symptom":"Windows install problem\/syestem file delete        Mistakenly i deleted system Reserve partition when i want to install new windows.

Could a millennial troubleshoot a carburetor or replace a part in a dishwasher? Oh no, there's no 'app' for that.A driver is the software that a hardware device like a graphics card or a network adapter needs to work properly. Your computer has dozens of hardware devices, so it has dozens of drivers,\u00a0but very few of those drivers ever need to be updated.Younger people are frequently under the impression that you need to keep all your drivers up to date. But the truth is: drivers are a good example of 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' Drivers rarely need to be updated, and when they do, Windows 10 takes care of that for you, because you have better things to do with your retirement.Will there ever come a time when you need to update a driver on your own? Yes, that's certainly possible. But is it likely? Not enough to worry about it. So go and enjoy your retirement - you've earned it."]},{"symptom":"Xbox one controller not connecting to PC or showing up in device manager        Hello,\u00a0I recently got a new PC and am trying to connect my new xbox one controller to play game on it.

Sounds really frustrating. Please type Indexing Options into your search bar and this will pop up a dialogue window. Then click \"troubleshoot indexing\".Keep hitting Next until it offers you some solutions that may help. If it doesn't, repeat my first step and go to advanced options. You will add a \"filetype extension\" to the Indexing options..........this *should* force Indexing to rebuild its search parameters and therefore include your files again.I have a hunch that the update jostled some things around and now your Indexing needs some TLC.","Hi Evan, thanks for the advice, I tried it but the indexing service is still as good as dead. File content indexing has passed away for good and file name indexing occasionally works if you access the searching tool from particulars paths which may change according to their own free will.
