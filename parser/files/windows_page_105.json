If you open each of the offending photos individually in the app, you will note that they do not have next\/previous arrows, which suggests, maybe, that the app doesn't know they exist.In case anybody else has experienced this, after some experimentation, I have found that one fix (there may be others) is to cut and paste the offending photos from their folder to another location \u2013 the desktop for instance \u2013 and then cut and paste them back to their original folder.

If this is your case, the product key isn't transferable, and you can't use it to activate another installation. (Unless you're re-activating a new installation on the same computer.)A Retail license refers to the license that you acquire when purchasing a copy of Windows 10 from your local store or an online retailer (such as from Microsoft or Amazon). If you have a Windows 10 Retail license, you can transfer the product key to another computer or upgrade major parts on your computer. A Volume license is designed for a large business, education, and government scenario. Usually, a Volume license allows organizations to use one master product key to activate any installation of Windows 10. Although you can use this license multiple times on different computers, you can't transfer it with the device when the system changes ownership, and you're not allowed to activate devices that aren't part of the organization.Source: https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/how-determine-if...
