{"windows":[{"symptom":"Minecraft Bedrock Edition, and Support        First thing is that I redeemed my code for my free version of Minecraft windows 10 edition and the code needed to fully redeem it (25 character code) was never sent to my email. Secondly, Microsoft needs to better clarify or make clear that their live support is only available till 8:30 PM Eastern time, I had no idea of this and have been waiting an hour to only realize I've been waiting on nothing. I saw no clear alert that this service will only be available at this certain time on this specific day until I went on my own and looked it up. Also even once I looked it up it never said the live support timings the only clear times stated were for calling and or a vocal conversation and not the live chat, so even once I saw this problem its still unclear to me. Also I find it hard to believe that in a matter of an Hour the microsoft support team can only take 1 support case every 20 minutes seeing that I began on a waiting list of 13 people and it took me 1 hour to get to the 8th position and then another 20 to get to 7, and finally I get to 3rd almost there and It has not changed for another hour. So all I needed was this code to be sent to me in what could be a near < 5 minute process instead has taken from around 8 PM Jan 11 2020 - 1 AM Jan 12 2020. Another tip, if there is going to be no \"live support agent\" make it clear to the customer that no one will be there and the agent is off work, otherwise I wont be the last person waiting 3 hours.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Problems after reinstalling old hard drive        Hello,I'm a tech consultant in a major big-box retailer. A customer came in with a laptop they had purchased from another retailer and was complaining about the overall sluggish performance of the machine. Its running an AMD A6 with 4GB of RAM and a 5400rpm HDD, so its pretty low end. I recommended upgrading to a SSD to improve day-to-day performance, which he opted to do. I transferred all of his information over to the new drive using USB\/SATA cables and got his computer up and running. I didn't erase his old drive so it contains everything that was on the laptop prior to me upgrading it.Unfortunately, I didn't transfer his settings or his printer drivers over, which meant that he's been unable to connect to his printer for the past few days. He was also missing some files and was complaining about mouse lag which didn't exist before. We eventually decided that given the litany of issues he was experiencing with the SSD it was probably best to put everything back to the way it was and reinstall the old HDD.After successfully reconnecting the drive, I am now experiencing a whole host of issues:1) I am constantly getting a CTFmon.exe error dialog box. It appears at the Windows login screen, and closing it only causes it to reappear after a few seconds. The box states \"Unknown Hard Error\"2) The start menu and task bar are inaccessible. I can mouse over the elements and the GUI responds as normal, but nothing actually launches when I click on them.3) The settings and device manager are also inaccessible. I've been attempting to launch them using Win + R and CMD.exe, but I've gotten errors both times. I saw a post on another forum that suggested checking for driver updates, but I'm unable to do this without having access to these utilities.4) I've attempted to boot into safe mode, but this results in a critical stop error that forces me to boot into Windows normally.5) Windows performed an automatic disk inspection on the second boot up and found no issues. I've tried running chkdisk myself manually, but this results in the computer locking up.6) Explorer is usable, so I'm still able to navigate the file system without much issue. I should mention I did receive an Explorer.exe error stating the class was not registered, but this has thus far only happened once.7) HDD activity has tended to stay in the 15-20% range, according to task manager.As far as I know the customer is running 1909 on the HDD. Performing a reset is not an option since doing so would wipe out his printer drivers\/settings and thus put us back in the same situation we were in with the SSD.I consider myself a technically minded person, but the vast majority of my knowledge is self-taught. I've researched this online but I've yet to find anything that matches this situation. Normally I would spend several hours pouring through every online resource I can find, but I feel like I've already wasted enough of this customer's time already and thought posting here would result in the fastest possible solution.I would appreciate any feedback or insight anyone can provide on this issue.","solutions":["Sorry to say so but your cloning process (which you did not elaborate on) was both incomplete and flawed.

The programs the customer had were mostly Office and Antivirus, which could be redownloaded by signing into the respective accounts through the web browser.Once Windows was fully setup and all updates had been downloaded and applied, I then connected the HDD via USB and moved the individual files (Documents, Music, Pictures, Videos, etc) using Windows Explorer.I essentially have two separate instances of Windows 10 installed on two different drives. The only thing they shared was the license key and the user's created content.\u00a0","This will probably explain why I'm not anybody's tech consultant ...When a computer has multiple, serious problems, and you can't even begin to understand what went wrong, I would not waste any time trying to fix that computer.

But the customer's printer is proving notoriously difficult to reconnect, which is why I'm trying to preserve the instance that's currently on the HDD.I can respect that.If the manufacturer of the printer in question supports that printer on Windows 10, it should install and work properly. If it does not, you ought to take it up with the manufacturer. They (allegedly) tested that model on Windows 10.If the manufacturer doesn't support Windows 10, I don't envy you. The printer is not guaranteed to work, and if it works today, maybe not tomorrow.About the HDD: Reconnecting the same, unaltered HDD to the same motherboard SATA connector in the same computer has zero consequences. You are merely putting back what was there before. Even in the unlikely event that the HDD was exposed to harmful static electricity in the interim, the drive would fail; it would not have individual performance problems.In my opinion, your customer's computer was messed up long before you touched it.

You can only experiment with the options and hope for the best.Game specific forums may have an rare out of the ordinary fix that applies to that game on occasions.\"can't stay at 60 fps stable but it can stay at 200 fps when it's not on?\"- V-Sync has always been an imperfect solution to screen tearing. It's effect on performance is similar to using a high Anti-aliasing setting,but it shouldn't normally cause a game that runs at 200fps to drop to 40fps.

I don't know if it helps with tearingas the fps don't go over 120.- I reckon enabling V-sync (or any other setting that has no enhance option) in both game and Control Panel may conflict,and generally only use the Control Panel for settings not available in the game, or if an in game setting such as V-sync is not doing the job.Some people are more sensitive to tearing or stutter as well. I rarely notice stutter, but don't do a lot of on line gaming with constantrunning and quick panning side to side, which is when it most evident.I do notice tearing and it was particularly noticeable when I changed from CRT @100HZ to flat panel @60HZ.

My Mrs is away with the computer at the moment. She's coming back on Thursday, so my plan is to put the HDDs into external caddies I have and connect them to my computer. The most important thing is if I can read them and get the data off, everything else is secondary. I'll reformat C if something in Windows has messed up and blank the drives if necessary (once the data is off), but I just don't know.One of my worries is that if the permissions on the drives are messed up I'll be hit with the 'you don't have permission to access' this drive' when trying to load it up on another PC.It's typical this has happened when my Mrs is away, it's making everything that much harder to troubleshoot and fix, fingers crossed for Friday though.","Hi,It is possible that somehow the drive letters got mixed up when they were unhooked and hooked back up..Especially if they were not connected to the same SATA Port as originally..There is also a possibility that the \"User Account\" somehow got messed up which could generate the \"d:\\Location is not accessible..\u00a0 Access is denied\"..It should be possible to overcome any Permissions issue should that become necessary..There are a number of bootable Linux based programs that should enable you to recover any data from the drives...

I've had it in the past where I've not been able to access a drive on a different machine due to permissions set on the first machine so it is a worry.Ah, I like your idea. I've only ever used Ubuntu once, years ago, I wouldn't have much of a clue how to set up a Linux machine now, hopefully it's easier now than it was then.I used a disk manager some time ago (I'd have to find the name of it), which allowed me to back up the boot drive in case the original drive failed, without having to unmount the drives, which was quite clever, I wonder, would that work? Or would it just copy the permissions over as well?Otherwise, I wonder, are there programs that can be put onto a bootable USB pen drive and back up a drive before booting into Windows?That would be handy if the contents could just be transferred to an external hard drive. I'd just reformat all the original drives then, just for ease and to erase existing permissions.","Hi,A lot of the Disk Management type programs will copy, image, or clone drives but that may not give the desired results..There are a number of Linux based programs that are available as an ISO image that can then be burned to a CD or Flash Drive.. I usually use a free tool called RUFUS to put ISO's on Flash Drives.. It is quite easy to use..The most important setting is to select \"MBR\" for the Drive Type to be created..One tool I use is called PartedMagic which was a free program but now requires a purchase to create the bootable media.. ISO's of the free versions are still available, but some of the sources are questionable..I trust this one..\u00a0 https:\/\/www.majorgeeks.com\/files\/details\/parted_magic.htmlIt runs much like windows, but does have some Linux naming of stuff.. It is not to hard to figure out as the drives retain their original name along with the size.. You would use the File Explorer\\Manager available on the Desktop.. It will not display both drives at once so you need to select what you want to copy.. open the target drive, then paste..I have used easier programs but at the moment I can't find or remember them..It is also possible to use the Command Prompt in Windows Installation or Repair media.. It may or may not ignore some of the permissions stuff.. You can use the Command Prompt to open a Windows Explorer window that will allow pretty much normal copy\\paste operations from one location to another...Here is the method just in case you might want to try it..The drives letters will be different than from within Windows, but their names will be the same..Boot computer from installation media...Select \"Repair\" on the lower left of the \"INSTALL\" screen...Select Troubleshoot.... Command PromptEnter NotePad into Command Prompt and hit Enter...Click on \"FILE\" Tab and select \"OPEN\"Click on ThisPC or use the Dropdown menu to browse to the files you want to copy...Right click on desired files and select \"Copy\" as normal...Browse to the location you wish to save the files and select \"Paste\", again as normal...Ignore anything on the bottom of the window concerning \"SAVE\", \"CANCEL\", \"File Type\", and ETC...You can also practice this method from within windows to give a better idea of what you will see..","Hi thereThe computer is going to be coming back today, so I should be able to look at things from hopefully tomorrow onwards and see what we're dealing with.Really hoping I can just copy the contents to another drive which I have ready and waiting...if not, I'll have to be employing some of your methods!Fingers crossed, I'll keep this updated when I know more.Thanks again for your continued help with this!\u00a0","OK... Good luck with that..","Hi thereI've got a bit of an update...We brought the computer back home last night so I've been testing things out today.I've tested all four HDDs in an external USB 3 dock.The errors etc., are replicated exactly as on the original machine.Two read perfectly.One is renamed a different drive (PHOTOS, randomly renamed to VIDEOS), but still reads OK.The important drive, the WORK drive, gives me the same error messages as I've outlined already, access denied etc.I tested again in Recuva, and doing that it can see the three main folders on the drive, it can also see that there are thousands of files on there and can find all sorts of deleted files in various states of being overwritten, so I thought, it doesn't appear that the drive is corrupted.So for the past few hours I've been using the free version of AOMEI Backupper to take the data from this misbehaving drive and put it onto one of my backup drives. It's transferred 808GB of around 900GB so far and it seems from the few files I've checked that I CAN open them on my machine.That will be fantastic if it works!\u00a0But it still leaves me with the question of what was the original problem? It could be as you said with the HDD shutdown issue, or maybe a Windows even a hardware fault.I don't know whether I should try reinstalling Windows 10 on this problem machine in case it's something to do with that.\u00a0Only problem is, I can't remember whether I had a disc for W10 or if we upgraded from W7 on their free upgrade program a couple of years back.Next hurdle to overcome..."]},{"symptom":"AirPods paired but won't connect.

It lags badly, scrolls opposite of the way I'm trying to scroll, and does this a little more or less depending on the website or app I'm using (Word is bad!)The last time I had this happen I had to do a clean install of Windows 10, but this fix only works for a while, apparently. I also get a different problem, where I get no sound from my headphones for YouTube videos and I have to re-install the driver to restore sound (although weirdly, I can hear the test sounds from the diagnostic tool.... Why?) Both of these problems occurred together about a year ago, and were only resolved after a clean install of Windows 10.So, within the past two days I have updated the pc, re-installed the touchpad drivers, done a reset of Windows 10 from the Surface link in Update and Security, done another reset of Windows 10 from the MS website, and nothing has changed. It looks like I need to load 1909 on a flash drive on a different pc before these problems are fixed again, temporarily anyway.Why is this a reoccurring problem? Why do I get these two problems together? Is there anything else I should do?Thanks for any suggestions.","solutions":["Hi JH.

It said system cannot be repaired. It was the initial screen when the booting problem just happened. After many trials and errors by trying to run system backups. Now every time I restarted the computer, it gave the \"Windows Boot Manager\" screen. The computer did not show the repair screen at all unless I disconnected the hard disk. But without hard disk, the Advance Options screen is useless.","Hi, I'm David an independent advisor and user just like you. I'll do my best to help you with this.You need to try and change the Boot Sequence for the computer - when the hard disc is connected the boot order is causing it to load from that and not even look at the USB drive.If you can get your USB drive to boot with everything connected you could then reinstall Windows.You'll need to try and get it in to the BIOS setting page at initial switch on - this varies by computer and can be tricky with a UEFI boot mode set. Right after switch on (before that boot error appears) does the computer give any prompts such as \"Press ESC for Boot options\" or similar? Often F2, F12, ESC, or another F Key will allow you to get either to the BIOS (to change the boot order) or just directly bring up a boot selection where you can choose you USB drive.Regards, David","By changing boot sequence, I was able to have the computer recognize the USB drive. However, recovery from the backup file still failed. I then tried to use the install USB drive prepared with media creation tool on another computer. The problematic computer rebooted through the install USB drive. It requested the product key during installation. I selected \"don't have the product key\" as I didn't rewrite down the numbers before the computer crashed. Then the process showed no update is available and stopped installation. I un-installed the hard drive and put it on a drive dock connected to another computer to check the HD. I noticed that all the contents were wiped out. Only partitions were reserved. I guess the disk was wiped out by an attempt of restoring my backup system file. Any way to reinstall Windows 10 without knowing the product key?","I'm afraid that a failed restored may be responsible for the drive appearing blank, yes. Although it could also be that there's a fault with the hard drive. As you already have the drive in a caddy on a different computer you could test the drive for faults by using Seagate's drive fitness test software - this is free and works even if the drive is not a Seagate. You want \"Seatools for Windows\" fromhttps:\/\/www.seagate.com\/gb\/en\/support\/downloads... Note: This is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it. As for the Product Key - there's no need to enter it because you are reinstalling on the same hardware - just skip it as you did and once Windows has installed it should reactivate automatically. Note that you must choose the same version as you had before (Home or Pro). The fact that the install stopped after you selected you didn't have the key is a different problem - perhaps because of a possible HDD fault?","Looks like the Windows Boot Manager (the boot loader for newer versions of Windows since Windows Vista) is failing to load the BCD (Boot Configuration Data, contains essential settings for Windows booting.)The \"Status: 0xc000000f\" line and the information actually tells a lot about what is happening. That's an NTSTATUS code indicating the file couldn't be found. (STATUS_NO_SUCH_FILE in case you needed to know the specific error text.) The \\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\BCD file is missing entirely, and that's critical for boot.\\EFI\\Microsoft\\Boot\\BCD isn't a directory path you're likely to see in normal operation. It's not on the C drive but rather on a special partition newer systems have called the EFI System Partition, which you guessed it, contains boot-critical files. So to fix this we will need to recreate the BCD information.You will need to have installation media on hand, because you need to be able to get to a command prompt in Windows PE, which is the environment Windows Setup normally uses. I wouldn't try to look for a recovery partition because the backup shenanigans likely removed the way to access it.Once you have install media, don't go to install now. Instead, press Shift-F10 (hold shift, press f10) to open a command prompt. Look for the drive letter that your system drive is assigned to (The one with the Windows directory, and that isn't lettered as drive X).Once you've found it, run these commandsbootrec \/fixmbrbootrec \/fixbootbcdboot [driveletter]:\\Windows","There is no Windows on the disk anymore. At least it is not displayed. The whole drive looked blank when I checked the disk on a disk dock. Anyway, I went ahead and tried bootrec \/fixmbr, it was successful. But when running \"bootrec fixmbr\", I got a message \"access is denied\". So I stopped there.I replaced the HD with another one and tried running the install USB drive. This time it went through and the windows was installed. Unfortunately, all my settings and software installed were gone. Good thing was that I had backup of data. I can move them back to the computer.\u00a0Additional note: I cannot say if I can trust Dell's restore program anymore (Dell computer).
