{"windows":[{"symptom":"Sync        How do you Sync your E-mail to this HP computer device from your personal cell phone?","solutions":["HI Vicky. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Your cell phone uses a sync app just like Windows 10 Mail, where you add your Mail accounts from their online source (Yahoo, AOL, Gmail, Outlook, etc) and they are all managed and accessible. But these are just sync services and while they will also sync your folders as far back as you tell it, the mail actually resides in the online (or Office) accounts.So I'dset up Windows 10 Mail app which is an easier way to access your mail from all your various accounts in one huge inbox that lets you merge all of your Office and Web Mail account, with an even larger ad-free reading pane. See here how to get started:https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/how-get-started-... Once you read over the tutorial if you have any questions or get stuck, just ask back. If it ever has problems the easiest fix is to just delete and add back the Mail account, nothing is lost. Again, the mail lives in its actual online account but this is a much easier way to access it than through a browser cluttered with ads. I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

Having different accounts and more importantly passwords is in the name of security. Having basic passwords such as \"123456\" or \"password\" are very easy to guess. And require very little effort for someone to guess or brute force your password if they wanted access to your accounts. This is the same reason why a number of services force the inclusion of symbols and\/or capital letters. And some force you to change it after a fixed amount of time.There are a number of steps you can take to make this process easier while keeping your accounts secure. Such as using password managers like those offered by LastPass, Google and Dashlane amongst others. And on trusted devices with supported software you can have the software remember your password for next time. By the way if you wish to skip the Windows login screen you can do so by opening netplwiz from the start menu or search box on the taskbar. Then toggling \"users must enter a username and password to enter this computer.\" off.I would also suggest you don't share passwords publicly like this no matter how simple or complex they may be. You risk your privacy and data by doing so.I hope that helps."]},{"symptom":"Mobile hotspot does not provide IP address        Hi,I am a huge user of the mobile hotspot functionality, but I recently installed updates KB4530684 and KB4533002 and since I cannot connect any device to the hotspot (but it starts, I can see it from my phone).

When resetting Windows, you should have the option to remove you files, then on the next window, there should be a 'Clean the Drive' option, that is a more secure option, but can take a long time to process . .."]},{"symptom":"windows 7 updating        Will not install all updates, says I'm missing 'Tray App.msi'.","solutions":["What updates are not being installed, and what is the complete text of the error message?Tray App.msi is related to HP printer software.\u00a0 Either reinstall your HP software package or uninstall all of HP's software other than the printers themselves.\u00a0 See, for example, this HP support article:\u00a0https:\/\/support.hp.com\/us-en\/document\/c00811375"]},{"symptom":"Base System Device        drivers not installed (code 28)","solutions":["Hi Anne.

I have replaced it with a D-Link modem and a NetGear router. I have them both set up and working fine.I multi-boot Linux and Windows 7 and use wired internet access. When my old setup (modem\/router combo) was running, all my OSes had internet access. Now with my new network all the Linux OSes have internet access but I haven't been able to connect with Windows 7 whereas it was connected on the old system.\u00a0I have tried downloading drivers and installing them but that didn't help. I have even went so far as re-installing Windows 7 but it still doesn't connect. I am far from a network guru. When trying to get Win 7 connected, I have gotten to the point that it was wanting my id and password that my ISP gave me. I input that but it didn't connect. I tried the ID and PW for the modem and that didn't work either.I am wondering if maybe there is a setting in the modem that needs to be enabled\u00a0 or changed. Maybe someone more knowledgeable about networking would have some suggestions that I could try?Thanks,hwms43","solutions":["Hi hwms43,but what is the error message you receive from Windows when you try to connect with Windows 7?Try running the Troubleshooter.If you prefer, post the screenshot.Have you already tried to connect with your PC directly to the modem bypassing the router?https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/10741\/windows-fix-network-connection-issues","When trying to connect my computer goes to 'Connect Broadband Connection'.
