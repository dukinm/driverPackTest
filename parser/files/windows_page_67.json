Normally, new computers are issued with digital licenses by the manufacturers unless retailers themselves issues a unique product key for the device.As per checking the attachment it seems that what you have here is a volume license key. These product keys are mainly used by large companies or organization that is being used by hundreds and thousands of computer on a network. Therefore, it would seem that your system is trying to look for the organization's network which the product key has been issued with.Unlike a full retail version product key, these are unique product keys that has transfer rights.
