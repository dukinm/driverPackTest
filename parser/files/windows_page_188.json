I installed a 2070 rtx super, with a ryzen 5 3600 cpu, on an msi tomahawk B450 max mobo. I also installed more memory, 16g ram and 500g ssd.I'm under the impression that my pc is fairly beefy, but i cant play any game at medium settings for more than about an hour or so before it crashes, depending on the game.I've seen benchmarks of the exact same system running higher graphic settings and performing very well, yet mine crashes. Has NEVER blue screened though.I've installed MSI afterburner to view my parts performance and everything is seemingly fine with my cpu temp being my only concern. it'll be at like 70-85 degrees at like 30-50% usage. otherwise my gpu's temps never go higher than about 45. nothing is overclocked.\u00a0I've gone into my bios and turned my cpu fan speed up to 100% at 30c yet it still reaches those temps. not sure if that has anything to do with it, but yea. also its a stock cooler that came with its own thermal paste.I've looked everywhere for answers but have found none. windows, bios, and all drivers are up to date.When i search in windows for \"reliability monitor\" there are mulitple codes that show on different days. the 2 main ones are;---------------------------------DescriptionA problem with your hardware caused Windows to stop working correctly.Problem signatureProblem Event Name: LiveKernelEventCode: 141Parameter 1: ffff9f0156bbd010Parameter 2: fffff80357e55850Parameter 3: 0Parameter 4: 43cOS version: 10_0_18363Service Pack: 0_0Product: 768_1OS Version: 10.0.18363.2.0.0.768.101Locale ID: 1033--------------and--------------DescriptionFaulting Application Path: C:\\Windows\\System32\\RuntimeBroker.exeProblem signatureProblem Event Name: MoAppCrashPackage Full Name: Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_1.13.0.18362_neutral_neutral_cw5n1h2txyewyApplication Name: praid:runtimebroker07f4358a809ac99a64a67c1Application Version: 10.0.18362.1Application Timestamp: 4539d5a0Fault Module Name: SettingsEnvironment.Desktop.dllFault Module Version: 10.0.18362.387Fault Module Timestamp: 10b406e4Exception Code: c0000005Exception Offset: 000000000002b605OS Version: 10.0.18363.2.0.0.768.101Locale ID: 1033Additional Information 1: 789aAdditional Information 2: 789aeef51da05995f207dcf202006addAdditional Information 3: 8c17Additional Information 4: 8c17ec3e550b29b30cbdc624f58b6172-------------I'm lost and feeling hopeless. please help.","solutions":["another thing, my psu is brand new and is 750w. also i ran the heaven benchmark and cinebench at the same time, having 100% usage from cpu at 95c and 90% usage from gpu at around 70c-80c with no crashes or stutters at all,so why is it only games at lesser graphic settings at that?","Hi M3Production Please check to see if your system has produced any minidump files . . .
