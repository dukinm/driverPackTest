Code 10 errors, status 0x0, device requires further installation. Just to list a few. There appears to be an issue in the registry. Uninstalling the driver\/device and restarting (twice) as directed in the troubleshooting steps hasn't fixed the problem. I have literally tried every troubleshooting process. The problems get worse with each cumulative and feature update. I used to have the 360 controller adapter and never once had a problem. It was rock solid and worked flawlessly.I have both styes of adapters. The older, bigger one and the newer, smaller one. Problems with both.... Driver problems with both...There are other threads of people having the same problems with this device. A hard fix that cleans the registry (completely removes the corrupt driver) will need to be the solution. Or develop a new driver entirely. Deleting\/reinstalling the driver over and over hasn't worked for me. Most of the discussions have the canned replies with links to the same troubleshooting sites. A waste of time. Any help from Microsoft support is greatly appreciated!","solutions":["Hi Sean.

Apologies for the delay. The link explaining known issues with NVIDIA drivers and GeForce Experience lined up exactly with what I was seeing on my end. The feature update to 1903 did something to my NVIDIA driver. I captured 2 snips. The first, a snip of programs and features. What it looked like before the feature update.The second, a snip after the feature update. This is after uninstalling geforce experience, as recommended in the link. I uninstalled it a few days ago and tried to reconnect the adapter. Here's the snip.I'm no longer able to uninstall driver 399.24 through programs and features. It appears to be the installed driver through device manager however.\u00a0 After uninstalling geforce experience, I was able to plug the adapter back in, line of sight, and reconnect to my controller. It paired.It's done this before, shows up as an audio device in settings.It also doesn't shut itself off after 15 minutes. In devices and printers through the control panel, It appears but with a little clock icon on it. The icon goes away after 10 seconds or so. I shut the controller off by holding down the center xbox button on the face until it powers off. The light on the adapter itself turns off also. There have been many times when the light on the adapter stays on even after the controller powers off. When that happens, I cant re-pair the controller to the adapter. Only unplug from USB and replug adapter back in will allow a re-connection to the controller.Since I would see pairing\/connection issues after cumulative updates also, I paused updates. I just wanted to play... I'm behind on updates with MS. I'm not prompted to download and install 1909 on my gaming rig. I'll follow up again after the updates on the 14th and thanks again.- Sean","Oh, and the firmware on the controller is up to date. Through the accessories app."]},{"symptom":"Microsoft Security vs Trend Micro        Can someone tell me if it is necessary to use another security program ie. Trend Micro if a new computer comes with Microsoft Security?","solutions":["Hi frog66TC, I am an independent advisor and a Microsoft user like you, and I would be happy to help you out with this.I have used the built-in Windows Security and no third-party security program for several years, and have not run into any issues. The built-in security also provides the best performance, whereas third-party applications generally tend to slow the system down and cause more problems than it is worth. It is not necessary to use another security program, especially if you are careful about the links you click on.For more information on Windows 10's built-in security, you can visit this website:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/compreh...I hope this has helped you.

It's your choice to make - no one can tell you what is best for you.When I made my choice, I preferred to rely on objective testing rather than the opinions of people I never met whose expertise was unknown to me (and easy to exagerate.) The professionals who test antivirus software for a living are the\u00a0real experts ... I turned to their testing results for my decision.If you do the same, you'll find that, while on any given day there are some products that are better than others, on the whole most antivirus does a fine job of defending a computer against malware. So your choice may be heavily influenced by how easy it is to work with the software, whether you like the user interface, whether you get good support and what other features come with the software. These are choices only you can make, after considering the facts.Most important of all is to appreciate that antivirus software is only a second line of defense against malicious attacks.\u00a0We, the computer users, are the first line of defense - our willingness to learn about the threats that face us and how to avoid them. No antivirus software can do that.","Whether you want to use Windows Defender or want to install another AV depends on your own preferences and habits.Personally, I prefer a third party product.No matter which AV you use, there might be situations in which you want to use other Anti-Malware programs for occasional, on-demand scans.Suggestion to read:Choosing an Anti-Virus ProgramSafe Steps for Replacing your Anti-virus - Why should you use Antivirus software?Supplementing your Anti-Virus Program with Anti-Malware Tools"]},{"symptom":"Not being able to hear anyone in Xbox Party chat Via Xbox Game Bar and Xbox Console Companion.

Digital license doesn't require a product key to be remembered.As soon as you do a clean install, you would find Windows activated. Just skip entering the key if prompted.Linking digital license to Microsoft has just one additional advantage, it helps you to transfer Windows License to another computer without calling Microsoft.","Since your key is from being on the computer when you bought it it is OEM and not transferable and as it is tied to the motherboard as long as you do not change the hardware there is no nee to save the key as you do not need it to do upgrades and updates."]},{"symptom":"outlook password blocking entry to my laptop        hi i am blocked out of my laptop because i havnt used it in so long and i dont have password to reset it, i have tried resetting through outlook with a different email address it sends passcode then asks questions that i cant answer so after 3 days im still stuck im running windows 10 system please somebody help me","solutions":["Hi, I'm David an independent advisor and user just like you.

I still think there is some problem with your memory and it could very well be what we call Virtual Memory. We may need to expand it, to do this please follow:1. Click the file explorer folder on the taskbar 2. Right click on THIS PC on the left pane and select Properties On this page make note of how much RAM you have installed. Now on the left pane theres a link that says ADVANCED SYSTEM SETTINGS, click that3. The window that opens click the Advanced tab, then click SETTINGS under Performance.4. Click the Advanced tab again, then Change under virtual memory. 5. There's a box with a check mark in it that says to automatically adjust your virtual memory or page file. Is it checked?If so look and see how much it says is allocated for virtual memory, it should be at 1.5x the amount of physical RAM. So if your system has 4GB of RAM the page file should be 6GB (6000ish MB, remember 1GB is 1024MB). Its ok to be a bit lower if the system is managing it as it uses more when its required and may not be needing it at this point.If that box is not checked off I would check off that box and reboot your PC. As for the update issue, you're always best off to download the media creation tool from the website. Run it as an update, not an install. It should choose to keep all your files straight away and update.

Well as the Title says: Dolby Atmos for Home Theater...I am testing a fresh Install of Version 1909 for the third week now. The MSHD Audio drivers were the only way to get Dolby Access (Atmos) working in Games at all, because with the Nvidia HD Audio drivers it is just not working at all, since 2018...BUT, now I see that even with the MSHD Audio drivers dated 04.09.2019 its not stable at all. It works for a couple of times and then It needs to be force reinstalled to be working again.Let me start with this Picture from 6 Months ago, when everything was just fine:Input is the signal which comes from the PC and it is Dolby Atmos, which then gets Outputed as Dolby Atmos 7.1.4 - everythings fine....But since 1909 we have this Problem:Somehow the Driver gets broken very fast and even when Atmos is selected as desired Output it send 90% of the time only 2.0 Mutichannel Signal to the Receiver.If force reinstall the MSHD Audio driver it works for like 1-2 times until something else is launched like Youtube or Spotify or anything else really, it will not work anymore.Also since 1909 if it somehow miraculously works it is not recognised as ATMOS anymore, but Multichannel signal, which is output as Multichannel 7.1.4 - which I do not think works like real Atmos in certain ways, but as a Virtual Height created by the Receiver.My question is, since the Problem of this nature is well known all over the Internet since Dolby Access exists, why do I have the feeling that this problem is like of the bottom of the priority list for the last 2 Years ?I mean we are talking here about stuff which affects like thousands of people with very expensive PC Hardware and even more expensive Audio equipment.Please start working together with Nvidia, Onkyo, DENON, Marantz, Yamaha and so on to get this finally working as it should.I mean nobody will use this, if it is broken and unrealiable. I am sorry to tell you, but I have to tell every customer which is buying a Home Theater system for Gaming, that Atmos is still not working without problems.
