On a previous version of windows (Windows 10 1709), the printer worked perfectly fine. Recently I updated to Ver. 1809 by wiping the computer but now the printer refuses to connect properly.On 1809, when I connect the USB into the computer, the printer is shown as \"IEEE-1284 Controller\", which is the actual cable, in Devices and Printers of Control Panel. If I click on its properties, it would list my printer model and \"USB printing support\". In Device Manager, my printer model is listed under \"Software devices\" rather than \"Printers\". I concluded it was a driver issue, and since the manufacturer's website said the printer's driver was built-in, I inferred it had to do with me updating it to 1809. I tried searching for other drivers, both manually and through window's own feature. Did stuff with \"Have Disk\" and adding printers manually using ports but all to no avail.Now I have downgraded back to an even earlier version, 1703. However it still does not work. When I plug in the cable, IEEE 1284 Controller is still there, and in Device Manager, the printer model is listed under \"Other devices\". In Control Panel, when I click on the IEEE 1284 Controller, it says it's a printer, however the \"Driver is unavailable\".I know that the printer is compatible and it does work on Windows 10, however I just have trouble installing the right drivers and Windows Update doesn't seem to do its job either. Could it be that it ONLY works on 1709? Cause that would be ridiculous.Any suggestions would be appreciated.","solutions":["Hi Justin.

They install themselves. No need to suffer any longer.I hope this helps. Hi Greg,Thank you for you reply, I really appreciate it. However, I am fully aware of the newer and much better printers available at low costs. In fact, I myself own much better printers. The whole point of creating this thread was to seek a solution to get my old one to work. Regardless, thank you for your response.---After countless hours of fiddling, I have finally figured out a solution, and hopefully it will benefit others as Im aware of the countless other threads on forums on the same issue.As of right now, I will assume it is because of the 1809 update, where Microsoft stopped including old printer drivers automatically in its feature update packages. I will test whether it actually also works on 1809 and 1903 through printer migration tomorrow.Steps:- Add Printer in Control Panel- Click \"The printer I want isn't listed\"- Select \"Add a local printer\" (last option)- Choose a Virtual USB Port (I chose the one with the largest number, though it really doesn't matter)- Click \"Windows Update\" on bottom right of window. This will ask Windows Update to fetch built-in drivers from all manufacturers- Find your manufacturer and printer model that matches the closest to your printer- Click \"Next\" and wait for Windows to install the driver. *This is where I ran into problems on 1809. It would always give me an error that says \"The printer was not installed.\" However, on 1703 it added the driver successfully.- Open Device Manager- Find your printer (Mine was listed under \"Other devices\", however Ive seen it under \"Unknown devices\" and \"Software devices\" as well)- Right click it and select Update Drivers- Click the 2nd Option (Something along the lines of installing a driver manually and NOT online)- Click \"Let me choose a driver from a list of available drivers on my computer\"- Choose \"All Devices\" and let it load a list of all installed drivers on your system- Find the one you installed earlier by matching your manufacturer and model to the list- Click \"Next\" and let it install the driver. If a message pops up warning about compatibility or digital signing, just click OK and let it install.- If it successfully installs you should see your printer under a \"Printer\" menu in Device Manager. The IEEE-1284 should subsequently disappear and you should have a working printer.Good Luck.","Justin, are you saying that the fix above works on the old version which you rolled back to? That version 1703 from early 2017 is so out of date I'm surprised it even lets you run it.Let us know if you find a way to install the driver in the latest version 1909 which is the media presently loaded into Media Creation Tool and latest if you want up to date security and quality fixes.Respectfully, we like to support Best Practices here and running a version that old in Windows 10 is a worst practice.","Hey Greg,Yes, the fix works on 1703, and should also work on 1709. The printer isn't ancient so I'm actually surprised it's not letting me install it on 1809.I will have to respectfully disagree with your best practice statement. While I no doubt believe that Microsoft continues to develop better and safe features in the newer versions, more often than not new upgrades break features and cause compatibility issues to users of all kind. I understand that Microsoft may not be able to provide support given that 1703 is over a year old, but numerous businesses, and for a variety of other reasons, 1703 is still widely popular. It isn't \"worst practice\" if one chooses to stay on an older version, especially if the newer one doesn't work like you wish for it to. What if I had not the capability to purchase newer printers?Thank you taking the time to respond though. I know you're just trying to help and I appreciate it.","Well I certainly understand the problem with later versions breaking things because we deal with this every day here. But that may be changing with some executive shuffling recently. The 1909 was so lean it only added all Updates to date and the ability to set appointments from the task bar Calendar. I was also speaking from personal experience with friends and family who gave up their serial devices some years back due to failing compatibility.But from all you've described if anyone can get it to work going forward, I will bet on you.

I am encountering a very frustrating problem for which I have yet to find an answer despite HOURS of research on forum after forum. The answers are always the same, and they have not helped me. When my new PCs go to sleep, they lose network connection. I truly hope someone can give me a real answer and not the typical, unhelpful, tech runaround (update your machine, update your drivers, blah, blah, blah). If the answer already exists in another question here or somewhere else, please someone just politely point me there, as I have been unsuccessful in finding it.The problem manifests like this:When either of my 2 PCs goes to sleep, its NIC seemingly does as well, and connection to my Synology home server is lost. This causes two problems:1 - Whenever the PC is woken, all desktop icons are gone except for Recycle Bin. The desktop must be refreshed (right-click\/Refresh) to restore icons (my Desktop folder resides on the server).2 - Any document that was open when the PC went to sleep reverts to Read-Only, resulting in having to Save As another document. All my documents reside on the server.Equipment:I have 2 identical Windows 10 PCs that I recently built (one for me, the other for my children). AMD Ryzen 5 processor. B450 AORUS PRO WIFI motherboard. Gigabyte BIOS, version F5, 01\/25\/2019.My NIC is an Intel(R) I211 Gigabit Network Connection.\u00a0The PCs are hardwired (ethernet cable, not WIFI) to a home network where all user account folders (Desktop, Music, My Documents, etc) are hosted on an 8 TB Synology home server.Let's get the obvious out of the way so folks don\u2019t have to waste their own time telling me to do things I have already done:1 - This is most likely NOT a server issue. Both previous computers (which were underpowered Windows 10 machines) did not exhibit this issue. Only the new machines do. I have changed no settings on my server at all.2 - Both machines are completely updated with all Windows 10 available updates installed.3 - My NIC has the newest driver package installed from Intel.4 - In Device Manager\/NIC Properties\/Power Management, \"Allow the computer to turn off this device\" isUNchecked.5 - In Device Manager\/NIC Properties\/Advanced, (1) Energy Efficient Internet is OFF (2) Wait for Link is Auto Detect (3) Wake on Link is Disabled (4) Wake on Magic Packet is Enabled (5) Wake on Pattern Match is Enabled6 - There is not a whole lot in my BIOS that I found helpful. I don\u2019t know if these are relevant, but I included the info anyway: (1) Under BIOS, Network Stack is Disabled (2) Under Power, Wake on LAN is Enabled7 \u2013 Because the BIOS is so new, the one thing I haven\u2019t checked for is a BIOS update. I highly doubt this would help even if there is one, but I hopefully will have time to check this sometime today anyway.Please excuse any perceived bluntness in my tone. At this point, I am just a bit frustrated and want this problem to go away. Hopefully one of you tech-savvy wizards out there can point me in the right direction. Thank you in advance. It\u2019s got to be something simple I am missing. I am fairly comfortable in Regedit or whatever needs to be done. I can post screenshots\/Snagits if needed.
