The reason the display works in the BIOS and the initial \"loading\" screens could be because the resolution and refresh rate will be different for those screens.Regards, David","Hi david,Thanks for your reply. Yeah I have had the same issue on a different display, I tried using different ways to connect the displays e.g. HDMI, VGA, and a DisplayPort cable all showed the same issues. I also connected the displays to my motherboard and the issue was there still.Its weird after the re installation of windows 10 it \u00a0will sometimes happen instantly, other times I get a few days where it works fine then the problem starts again.Is there any software or any checks I can do to see if my GPU is damaged?Thank,Kyle.","You can try running FruMark - I've use this one myself. It's designed to work the graphics card really hard so is likely to show up a problem (especially with overheating) very quickly.https:\/\/downloads.tomsguide.com\/FurMark,0301-27...

If so would be worth turning that off to see if things settle down.Are there any BIOS updates for your mainboard you could install?","Okay thanks ill run FruMark and see if that brings anything up.No i\u2019m am staying away from overclocking as I don\u2019t want to do too much damage as i\u2019m pretty new to building my own PC.No not yet ill try that too, I did install all the drivers from the CD but never checked if there were updates for my BIOS.I did try uninstalling, reinstalling, and updating the drivers in the device manager for my displays in safe mode but that didn\u2019t do anything.Thanks,Kyle.","Hi Kyle and thanks for reaching out! I'm an Independent Advisor and a Microsoft user like you. Please allow me to assist with your issue.I just wanted to chime in a little. There is a known issue with the GPU and certain displays with G-Sync enabled. Do you happen to be using such displays? If so, do check out the compatible list of displays from NVIDIA here:https:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/en-us\/geforce\/products\/g...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

If this was the issue I had my PC running for about 2 months before I started to experience this issue.thanks,Kyle.\u00a0","Hi Kyle, the list shows displays that are compatible with NVIDIA G-Sync. Both the displays you have are not compatible so G-Sync shouldn't have been enabled. Your displays do support AMD Freesync.Anyway, please verify in your NVIDIA Control Panel that G-Sync aren't enabled.","Hi Comnuts,yeah I just checked the Nvidia control panel and it doesnt look like G-Sync is enabled. I also removed my graphics card and used the VGA port on my motherboard and the issue was there still. The display itself doesnt flicker on and off, the actual information being displayed is what is being affected.its like if you switched between 2 monitors with different resolution and the PC auto detects and adjusts the resolution for you, just without changing monitors. Thats probably the best way I can describe it.\u00a0Thanks,Kyle","Ok, and since you were able to enter BIOS within out the flickering, it means your CPU is good. Pretty much narrowed to Windows.Can you do one more check that Variable Refresh Rate isn't enabled in Windows Settings? It's not supposed to be enabled by default as well.https:\/\/devblogs.microsoft.com\/directx\/os-varia...","I have had a look and I cant find that option in my settings, I noticed on that page you linked that it wont show if you dont have some requiremnts, I have windows 1903 installed so I\u2019m guessing I dont have the other requirements to see the option.I have tried re-installing windows multiple times but the same problems comes back after a little bit.Thanks,Kyle."]}]}
