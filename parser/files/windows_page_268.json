Ya - every time I reboot, it works for at least 2 minutes. The problem is that Windows, after the 2-minute \"reboot honeymoon\" is over, these malfunctions recur and persist until the next reboot. I can't disable focus assist. I believe the persistent malfunction may be related to the overwhelming Notifications failures. During those failures, the hover-over text for the notifications icon tells me I have a number of new notifications; however, opening the notifications pane causes Windows to report erroneously that there are no new notifications. These persistent errors and malfunctions can be quite frustrating. That's when I get it on with Microsoft Support. My favorite is when they tell me the problem is fixed just because rebooting the PC makes the Windows malfunctions disappear for a moment or two. . . It makes my anger gauge go out the roof.","I am using a preview build of Windows 10 (currently build 18361.1) and I seem to have a similar issue (maybe a little different). I have reported it in the Windows Feedback Hub, and I uploaded a video capture on the Hub of me reproducing this error. I have not yet had any responses.In my situation, Focus Assist activates every time I click the Show Desktop button, OR if I minimize all windows so that only the desktop background is showing. Every time I do this, Focus Assist activates. I can repeat the issue by going to the notification bar and turning off Focus Assist, then clicking the Show Desktop button or opening up a window and then minimizing all windows again.I have narrowed it down to an option in Focus Assist called \"When I'm using an app in full screen mode\". If I turn this OFF, then problem no longer occurs.\u00a0\u00a0 However, you may not have this option as I think it is only currently in the preview version of Windows.In my situation, Windows thinks that when the desktop background is the only thing on the screen, it thinks it's in \"full screen mode\" and activates Focus Assist.For the record, I am using an nVidia RTX 2060 with the latest nVidia drivers (currently 419.35, however I have used previous drivers and had the same issue). I mention the video card and driver as this issue seems to be display\/full screen related and I thought there might be a connection.The below screenshot shows the option I'm talking about. If I disable this option, then the problem goes away, but Windows should not been treating the desktop background as a \"full screen\" app to begin with.\u00a0 Something is wrong.","Same here after Windows 10 May update on 2 different machines: nVidia video card and desktop background treated like full screen app...Switching option off in Focus assist section apparently fix it.If you have this issue upgrade to Windows 1903 to enable the switch.Anyway...

It will get installed by default. I suggest you to disable the Bluetooth driver from Device Manager.Hope the information is helpful. Feel free to write to write to us for any other assistance with Windows, we\u2019ll be glad to assist you.Thank you.\u00a0","I know this is an old thread, but I (and apparently others) am having the same problem to this day with no resolution. I tried all steps above, even searched registry keys for Bluetooth devices, but the old devices persist after a reboot, uninstallation through device manager, and through the Settings app. Not only does this\u00a0issue resolve through the\u00a0usual suspects, it causes crashes to my Settings app.\u00a0This is obviously either a bug in Windows 10 that Microsoft is unwilling to recognize, or there is something that is not fully being explained to the general public with Windows 10 and it's Bluetooth management. This issue is now affecting me at work, costing me and my company time and money. There has to be a solution to this, but I can't find it, nor will it resolve itself, nor is there an update that resolves this. I am filing a KB immediately following publishing this post.","It seems to help to turn on airplane mode \/ turn off wifi to remove bluetooth devices... maybe it helps!","It may be an old thread but the problem hasn't been fixed. It effects more than just bluetooth headphones too. Windows 10 just gets stuck with any device you pair. It will never uninstall. Have you found a solution?","worked beautifully once I understood and followed the instructions","I had the same issue.\u00a0\u00a0(1st ) Turned Airplane Mode on\u00a0(2nd) Disconnect Bluetooth device from sound Settings (Also remove it from default device)(3rd) Open device manger--> View--> Show Hidden Devices. In Bluetooth devices Uninstall the Bluetooth device you want to remove.(4th) Go to Device and Printer in Control Panel and Try again removing again.\u00a0The device should be removed. Let me know if this works for you.","This issue still persists here (with all the methods above tried). I believe a registry hack is required.Fix your buggy OS.","In case this ever helps windows devs to fix the issue I found a workaround in my particular case:The conflict was caused by using a different Bluetooth adapter that also had pairings.By plugging that adapter in and removing the device it managed to remove it permanently for the first adapter too (or it let the first adapter to remove its pairing too).\u00a0Of course that was a horrible workaround that should never be needed since if I didn't have the second adapter available the issue would not be solved for the first adapter.PS. I had also used 'show hidden devices' so it's not that (the second adapter's pairing did not show in that)"]},{"symptom":"Minecraft Windows 10 Edition        I bought Minecraft in 2014 and I have been trying to claim my copy of Minecraft for windows 10 since 2016.
