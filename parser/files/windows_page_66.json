There is only official support until windows 8.1. Sometimes those drivers will work with Windows 10.

(I have given myself permissions to open another Windows Apps folder which I installed on another HDD when I installeda game demo from the MS Store, but I'm not game to mess with the main folder in C:\\ ).Whatever the case. Game Bar cannot be uninstalled. It was built into Windows by Big Brother MS.There may be a way, but the risk of borking Windows trying to uninstall it wouldn't be worth it just to have it removed from Settings.The shortcut can be removed from the Start menu using commands, but that's it..","Hi BossDweeb,I did not make the comment that it takes up too much space (I think it's only 84 kb, not an issue)...\u00a0 it just bothers me that if I take automatic updates I can't turn around and uninstall programs I don't want\/need\/wish to have on my laptop.\u00a0 I agree with you - it's not worth losing sleep over; I was just curious if someone from MS could provide an easy solution.","It could take up 50G and I wouldn\u2019t care, IF i actually wanted it that is.The fact that I neither asked to download it or was asked if I wanted to during an update bothers me a little bit, but what is more concerning is that not only is the \u201cUninstall\u201d button greyed out (why even offer it?), but clicking on the \u201cTerminate\u201d button does ab-so-lutely nothing.My main gripe however is that I have and older PC (not everyone can afford to upgrade every year or two), and it slows my system to a crawl during boot up, and then I still have to wait for the game bar to pop up before I can close it. Is it still active and running in the background, gobbling up the minimal RAM I have on my dinosaur PC?Not everyone is a gamer, and its beyond presumptuous to force it on users simply to push a product.","There is a lot not like about Win10. Even if disregarding the tedious bi-annual version updates, and the 'apps' that cannot beuninstalled. I could go on for hours (did actually, but realised I was most likely boring people so I've cut most of it out).However, we have to work with, and around what we are given, and if so inclined, post complaints frequently via the Feedback app.I doubt MS respond to less than millions of complaints on a specific issue though (Even before Win10, but they didn't even havea feedback option before).----------------------------------------- Anyway, back on topic....\"and it slows my system to a crawl during boot up, and then I still have to wait for the game bar to pop up before I can close it.\"- Hmm, I wonder why ?\u00a0 If it's not enabled in the Gaming Settings it should not be launching when you boot into Windows.I certainly never has on my machine. Have a look in Task Manager > Startup tab, and if you see it listed there you can disable it from launching with Windows.While you are there you can disable anything else you know you don't need to load when booting into Windows.If it is somehow running in the background, even when not enabled in either location, you can end the task\u00a0 bylocating it in Task Manager > Processes. Not a desirable thing to have to do, but sometimes you gotta do....Running DISM may fix a Game Bar always on issue. If not the more extreme measure of doing a Repair reinstall may be the only option.DISM - Repair Windows 10 Image - Windows 10 Forums[EDIT: I was browsing a link given by Greg on another GB thread.- If you have not already uninstalled the XBOX app, try Reset in option #4, or just uninstall the XBOX App.The two features are apparently interconnected.Failing that, check out the part of the article relating to deleting Game Bar keys from the Registry (back them up first as a precaution).This deals with Game Bar corruption, and may help with your Game Bar auto-run issue.https:\/\/www.askvg.com\/fix-game-bar-is-not-opening-or-working-in-windows-10\/- In your case not opening Game Bar after deleting the keys may be the better solution, but if the problems persists even with itturned off in Game Settings, you may need to open Game Bar and rebuild the Registry keys as per the instructions.]- I've never used Game Bar, but assume the uninstall button may not have been removed because MS are working on some otherstrategy [EDIT: maybe linking Game Bar to the XBOX app]. Still strange they would leave an option that only leads to frustration, but MS works in mysterious ways.- Regarding your older PC. Just how old and how much system RAM ? (Not to do with age, but be glad you are not one of the poor souls who bought tablets\\notebooks with criminally small 32GB memory chips.soldered into the machine in lieu of a proper SSD\\HDD.\u00a0 E-waste at it's finest.\u00a0 The Windows folder alone hovers around 20+GB. )- Note that while you may see a lot of RAM in use, this may be because Win10 does a better job of using RAM than previous Windows.At idle, my Win10 64bit averages around 2.5+GB with 8GB RAM. Win7 64bit used about 1.5GB w\/ 8GB RAM with pretty much the samethings loading when booting into Windows.Rather than have X GB's of RAM sitting empty Win10 caches more commonly used data than previous Windows, but when a programrequires more RAM, Win10 (should) reallocate more RAM to the program running in the foreground if required.This has caused a fair amount of confusion, even from people with 8GB or more RAM who are accustom to seeing most of their RAM 'free'.If your machine has less than 4GB RAM it may have issues, but only if you are a heavy multi-tasker or run programs such as Photoshopwith large files.Does your machine have an HDD or SSD ? Win10 does seem to favour running from an SSD. I keep a backup of my Win10 on an7200rpm HDD, and booting from the HDD (to verify the cloning process worked properly) is slow as molasses in winter.*He heads off for a cup of coffee*.If your machine is running slowly in general you may want to run Disk Cleanup, if you haven't done so in a long while.Select the Cleanup System Files option for a more thorough job of deleting old update backups and files.----------------------------@Sherry...- Check out the article I linked to in my Edit above.- Unfortunately, no one with any influence at MS headquarters\\development team hangs out at these forums.The feedback app is as good as it gets..","Is this a virus or adware? I never downloaded it nor do I need it. I powered up my notebook today and it popped up as I was surfing the Internet.I am also having a similar problem and am unable to install it.","Thanks for the lecture on how the Xbox Game Bar is not using up that much space.\u00a0That was not the question though. And we should be able to delete any software we don't want. I'm tired of Microsoft putting things on my computer that I don't want. And it's only going to get worse if we don't complain.\u00a0","I have IOBIT Uninstaller (it's free) and it deleted Xbox Game Bar with no problem."]}]}
