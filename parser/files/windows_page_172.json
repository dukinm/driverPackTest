I have a good set of Bose speakers connected to the Headphone\/Mic Jack. It has worked without issue.

I switch between outputs using the option within the volume icon in lower right of screen.\u00a0 Both options will work. But if I have been using the system speakers, and switch to the Soundlink speaker, it will continue to play only on the system speakers. And vice-versa. I have gone into Sound Settings and made the suggested troubleshooter changes i.e. Disable Enhancements. When I press the \"Test\" button, it does play on the proper selection, so I know that the connection is there. My only workaround has been to restart my PC, then select the output I want and it will play on that output. If I try to change back to the other output, it will not play. I have to again restart PC. I looked at the option to change from the factory supplied Realtek driver to the generic Windows driver but it warns you that it might not be compatible with the system, so I backed away from that. The Bose Soundlink speaker worked seamlessly with my older Win 7 PC. I am using as the music source an up to date version of Apple I-Tunes.

Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.

You would make a fine detective.I performed driver updates in the first step. Most of them indicated that they were up to date. Since this is a brand new PC I sort of expected that. Only a Video Adaptor actually did an update. I stuck to the drivers that I deemed relevant to the issue, since their were a massive amount of possible drivers. I also included Bluetooth drivers, since that function seems to have the same symptoms as the original problem System and device indicate that they are connected but no sound is forthcoming.I got into step #2 restoring possibly disabled Windows Audio Service. I arrived at the step to merge file with registry and got the warning dialog box stating that it could harm the system. I did not proceed as I am very unknowledgeable about registry functions. Do you think I should go forward with this? In the list with the file, it shows that WAS is Running.Again, thank you for your patience. Some of these actions are intimidating for me, and I would like to get my sound system running properly.Jeff","No need to restore the WIndows Audio service if it's running. Proceed and keep asking any questions. I'll be here for a few more hours and then check in morning.","Greg: Thanks again for your efforts. I have worked on your checklist for most of today. In particular, the adjustments to sound settings etc. I have performed most of the steps in your Performance & Integrity list. My PC was set up to do the Maintenance check on a scheduled basis, and actually ran one early this AM. I am running it right now again. I got to area of disabling various services. I am not sure about the ones dealing with Intel,HP,RealTek, and Apple. Is there a risk to disabling any of these? In Task Manager, there is Itunes Helper,HPseuNestLaunch,KeePass,MS One Drive,Windows Security. Should these be disabled as well? The next step dealing with startups is a bit confusing. The list is extensive and I am not sure what damages might be done here by someone with as little experience as I have. On the restore point, the PC has only been in service for a week, and the problem has been there since the startup.What I am seeing is that there is a connection to both of the output sources. Once I begin using one to play Itunes I am unable to switch to the other without restarting the PC. The only step that I did not try was installing the Windows Generic Sound Device, given the warning dialog box I received before doing the switch. If you think this might help the problem without collateral damage, I might be inclined to try it. Please give me your thoughts on that.I've taken up enough of your time for now. Thanks again.\u00a0 Jeff","It depends on what the Service or Startup is. Can You post a screenshot or verbatim Google them to find out.","There isn't any risk to trying all available drivers for the controller model. You can rven try all previous drivers in Device Manager by choosing Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick. >","The blind squirrel eventually finds the nut. I figured it out! After all the tests on the Win 10, I got to thinking that possibly I-Tunes needed to be investigated. In the IT app I went to Edit>Preferences>Playback>Play Audio Using>\u00a0 The drop down menu offered \"Windows Audio Session\" which had been selected, and \"Direct Sound\". I selected it, restarted I-Tunes, and voila! I was able to toggle between the two Outputs with no problem.\u00a0 I am thinking that this issue might well solve my Bluetooth glitch, as well.

I am using 256GB ssd drive and i noticed that my 80 GB space is consumed by '.pcm' files located in Windows\/temp folder. i deleted those files but some of them are still used by audiodg.exe and thats why i could not delete the files and the problem is the size of files are increasing like 1 mb in a second. i dont know the cause of this behavour. This is the file name \"skwsrefmfx_2019_7_5-3_9_39_302.pcm\" and there were lot of files there and still modifying itself. can someone help me with the issue.* Moved from Virus & Malware","solutions":["What is AUDIODG.EXE \u2013 Larry Osterman's WebLog\"The short answer is that audiodg.exe hosts the audio engine for Vista.\u00a0 All the DSP and other audio processing is done in audiodg.exe.\"Pulse-code modulation - WikipediaMPEG-4 File Source - Windows applications\u00a0| Microsoft DocsSo obviously since that executable relates to audio and the PCM file type is an audio storage type, those files must be some sort of audio recording, though what's actually creating them is still in question.The \"skwsrefmfx\" portion at the beginning of the file name may provide a clue, since one thing that would clearly use this audio engine is Skype and since the first 2 letters are \"sk\", that may imply it's some sort of Skype audio recording.\u00a0 But that's just a guess, since I didn't find this filename online other than within your own posts.Rob","I have same problem. This is a just a report, with an unsatisfactory work-around. Apparently, what is happening is that audiodg.exe is recording sounds and saving them in Windows\/Temp. If I play music from Amazon, for example, the current skwsrefmfx_*.pcm file continually grows in size. If I go to Settings to Manage sound devices and Disable the microphone, the current *.pcm file ceases to grow. For me, this problem may have begun when I updated to Windows 10 1903. If it actually began then, it's possibly a bug in the latest Windows 10\/audiodg.exe.","So you're thinking that the microphone may be engaged automatically when a streamed music file is being played, saved to these temporary PCM files that for some reason also aren't being purged once the streaming activity ends?Sounds from your description like this makes sense, so the question as you've inferred is what is triggering the audiodg.exe to begin recording.\u00a0 It's also important to know whether these files can be deleted manually, since if they're still locked that indicates they aren't ever being closed.The other question that comes to mind for me is does this happen for everyone or only a small number like yourself?\u00a0 If that's true, then I'd be looking at what makes your specific systems unique, like what computer and especially what sound device, driver and\u00a0version are in use.\u00a0 If those are the same for both of you, that may point at possible involvement and even a potential solution if a different driver is available.Rob","Rob, I normally have my Hades Canyon NUC microphone array on 24\/7 so as to use Cortana in the same way other people use Alexa and so as to answer incoming telephone calls.Windows 10 Storage Settings\/Storage Sense does not list the *.pcm files when listing other temporary file groups, so it will not and cannot delete them. To delete them, I needed to go to Windows\\Temp in Explorer. You were spot on when you said the issue is with or via audiodg.exe because when I tried to delete the *.pcm files, Windows 10 would not delete the *.pcm file currently open. It was in use by \"audiodg.exe.\" Apparently, audiodg.exe records in blocks, so I could delete 100+ GB of blocks filling my drive, even with the microphone on.I submitted a report to the Windows Feedback Hub as a Serious issue. Hopefully, they'll fix it or get back to me for further tests. An internet search pulls up similar problems a few years ago associated with audio. It's not likely to be the Realtek driver, as that has a 2018 date. Likewise, Windows Defender didn't find anything suspicious. I suspect that some developer at Microsoft was debugging audiodg.exe (or Skype) in 1903 with some software switch turned on so as to record. He or she forgot to turn it back off. Skype does have a recording feature for Skype to Skype calls, but I've never seen a button for it, as I don't do such. In any case, Skype-help says that Skype saves the recording in the cloud, not on anyone's drive.","I also am experiencing the exact same issue with the Intel Hades Canyon NUC. Could it possibly be something unique to the Realtek or Intel Drivers and their interaction with Windows 10 1903 on this system?skwsrefmfx PCM files continuously grow in C:\\Windows\\Temp and are recording everything that the microphone array picks up unless I disable that device.","Reasonable supposition, Olympia. First way to test it would be on a non-NUC computer with different mike but same OS state. Another avenue of attack would be to find out the significance of the file names. A simple search for\u00a0skwsrefmfx_*.pcm turns up nothing.","I had this same problem recently, only noticed something was fishy when I saw the C: Drive on my 128GB SSD go down to 3GB Free space and in the RED.. it's taken some figuring, and daily I was deleting the .pcm files from C:\\Windows\\Temp but there was always a couple I couldn't delete, but I managed to clear more space in the least.So I got to researching a bit more and saw .pcm files related to AUDIO, then I happened upon this post which gave me a little more confirmation of what I suspect was going on... Something was constantly recording\/using the Mic, it seems?So, I went into Windows Settings > PRIVACY > MICROPHONE and looked at which Apps were using the Mic.. I only have a few usually as I'm very selective on my privacy settings and have things within there all locked down, however, since the 1903 update it would appear the Microsoft Edge and Cortana were both now allowed to use my Microphone too!\u00a0 Something I'm pretty sure I had not allowed it to in the past as I dont use Edge Browser nor Cortana, but possible maybe Cortana was on previously?I turned this option off in Microphone settings for both Apps to stop them being allowed to use the Mic, instantly the biggest .PCM file and a couple others which had been totting up their totals and getting bigger all day long whilst my machine was on stopped doing so.\u00a0 I then deleted all files again from C:\\Windows\\Temp only 1 .PCM file remained, the one it was last writing to I guess.\u00a0 So I rebooted my system, went back in there and then deleted that one too, it was gone... As of yet nothing has written any .PCM files back into C:\\Windows\\Temp but I will come back and advise it that changes!In my case it seemed these two Microsoft Apps were causing the issue, the only other App I have being allowed to use the Microphone is SKYPE and that from what I can tell isn't creating .PCM files, but then I have not actively used it to make a call as yet either, it usually just sits running in my System Tray as I receive calls mostly through it via a Skype Number if people call that, which they haven't recently!The files never deleted themselves after reboot, that was the biggest issue, but the mystery remains as to why are they doing it, they didn't used to be prior to 1903? or that I noticed anyway, my disk space never dropped enough for me to notice maybe?Possible maybe other MS Apps are causing similar issues too, but I don't want to mess too much with my system as it's my working system and I don't want to break anything and have to rebuild!I'd be interested to see and know if this works for anyone else.\u00a0 Certainly a new issue which arose after the 1903 update so maybe a Bug?\u00a0 I'm just glad my disk isn't being eaten away any longer :)UPDATE: 22 July 2019------------------------Further update on my .PCM file issues and how I've kind of sorted it.\u00a0After a little more time with every App other than Skype no longer using the Microphone in WINDOWS SETTTINGS > PRIVACY > MICROPHONE I found that .PCM files were still being created, however, most were Zero Byted and cleared regularly themselves or upon Reboot... There was however one other of about 2MB in size being created none we're certainly taking up Gigabytes of space on my C: Drive like when I had both Microsoft Edge and Cortana set to ON to use the Microphone. Unfortunately the 2MB file remains present even after reboot and when deleted it soon returns, but it's small so I can live with that, it was the whopping huge Gigabyte sized ones I couldn't!So I figured I would goto the WINDOWS SETTTINGS > PRIVACY > MICROPHONE and disable it completely for a period and turn off the Microphone completely from this setting, hey presto, no .PCM files at all being created. :)Certainly seems to be for me personally that Edge and Cortana were the biggest issue and this was never an issue to my knowledge before 1903 so very strange indeed.I can live with the smaller .PCM file and Zero Byted ones which I assume is safe to say is down to Skype now being the only App I have using the Microphone in WINDOWS SETTTINGS > PRIVACY > MICROPHONE, they're not going to cause me any major issues but one has to wonder why this is happening suddenly? For now I have re-enabled the Mic for Skype as I do wish to use that on occasions and as the only App now using the Mic the problem for me is mostly not a problem any longer.I'd be interested on any other feedback, are other MS Apps causing similar issues when they want to use the Mic, as I mentioned previously I didn't want to mess around too much myself and mess my system up too much, I just wanted to stop the Huge files from being created which I seem to have managed to do.Hopefully some kind of fix however will be forthcoming.\u00a0 Will have to be sure and tell some friends using 1903 of this because they'll likely hit similar issues.I hope my posts have helped others here also.All the best","I have the exact same problem.

Is this evidence the laptop screen may have died or become disconnected from it's wire harness?If there is at least a signal then what would be next is to try to reset the CMOS to make the BIOS accessible again:https:\/\/www.maketecheasier.com\/how-to-reset-cmo...https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/reset-pc-bios-...Once you can access the BIOS to reset to defaults, check the hard drive is detected in it's settings - usually under Storage. If not reseat it to try to get it detected. Then proceed with steps I gave earlier to troubleshoot install.","I haven't performed any steps yet, so let me address some of your questions:Dell XPS 8930 Desktop1. Replaced the HDD.2. Downloaded Dell's OS Recovery Tool to build an installation media file (USB).3. Followed directions to reset the new HDD (Dell's AssistSupport).4. Media installation completed and I removed the USB.5. Initial steps of install performed fine. Was presented with initial Windows install screens.6. Prompted to establish internet connection.\u00a0 Successfully connected with personal wifi.7. Windows proceeded with install; provided message of \"We have important <steps to perform>\"8. Walked away for 60-90 minutes and when i returned, there was a black screen.9. Waited 30 minutes and nothing. Turned PC off.Now:When attempting to boot up PC, i see there is power in the PC tower (fan, etc), but the monitor never wakes up and i cannot see if there is a Dell logo appearing.The keyboard and mouse light up but i can't tell if they are responsive.I'm double checking the monitor now.\u00a0 When I plug my laptop (different device) to the monitor, it recognizes the device (monitor is not in power saving mode) but it doesn't display my laptop.\u00a0I need to rule out the monitor first and then see if I need the CMOS.","I read those steps 1-9 in your first post which got sidetracked into Dell Recovery media which is not a Clean Install and has its own problems. I gave the correct way to proceed in my first post using Windows 10 Media only, which I thought Dell is recommending now anyway. If the monitor isn't displaying your laptop, either, then it's a monitor problem. Replace the monitor or borrow another.","Yep... It must have been coincidence or something cause i've now tried two laptops with the monitor and i can't duplicate\/extend\/show only on the PC's monitor.Regarding initial thread... Yes. I'm going to move forward with Microsoft's installation media and abandon Dell's OS Recovery method.\u00a0\u00a0I'll repost to this thread once i get the monitor squared away.","Good. Keep me posted on your progress as I will be here to help until the case is resolved.","Well whaddya know...\u00a0 The PC's monitor must have failed me last night during hte windows install.\u00a0 The black screen i experienced could've been a situation where the install was still performing or pending a question to the user.Now:Using a TV as a temp monitor, i booted the PC and it progressed past the Dell logo. No USB device inserted in PC.I did hit F12 several times to get into UEFI but it went straight to a windows install prompt.I'm now prompted with a 'Why did my PC restart?\" screen and it's suggesting i click next to establish a wi-fi connection.What do you think... Should I continue with this Dell OS media install (from the OS Recovery Tool)? or get the MS media and do another complete install (re-wiping the HDD)?Regardless, i think we can take CMOS off the table.","Sorry to bother you... You've been a great help to me!I started researching MS Windows Install Creation Media and it occurred to me:Even if I get the image on the USB flash, how will I be able to intercept the boot up and get to UEFI\u00a0 (see above where it ignored my F12)?","Update:I have the Win 10 installation media (from MS) on USBInserted USB into PC and booted upAs i suspected, I couldn't intercept UEFI and i'm back to completing the install with Dell's SupportAssistSince I'm dealing with a new HDD, I'm thinking I let the Dell SupportAssist complete and then just do a complete new install with the Microsoft installation media.\u00a0 I know this is time consuming but it puts me in a position of getting a clean install...\u00a0"]}]}
