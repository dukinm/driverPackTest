Original Title: Wireless logitech keyboard and mouse lags intermittently suddenlyHave had Logitech M185 mouse and K270 keyboard for years and got a HP preinstalled Windows 10 PC this past Christmas w\/o any issues until yesterday.I noticed huge lag in keyboard responsiveness and then slight lag with mouse. Ended up replacing with fresh batteries to no avail.Then switched USB from hub to PC itself and 2 USB ports, resinstalled drivers (even though it said everything working well). Noticed that some of the things I did made it work temporarily and then sometimes mouse worked but keyboard not at all.Tried to restore Windows 10 OS to last month when everything worked well but took forever and I had to leave but my wife says screen says it failed.Using corded mouse\/keyboard without any issues (had to use to restore\/log in during multiple restarts, etc).Any thoughts or suggestions? I have not installed anything lately although Windows updates itself along with a few other programs. Working well for almost 5 months.\u00a0","solutions":["Hi Jack,\u00a0I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with\u00a0Windows 10.\u00a0I will certainly help you.\u00a0This issue might occur if mouse and keyboard driver is corrupt.\u00a0I suggest you to follow the methods below to\u00a0run hardware troubleshooter.

I have been having issues connecting my wireless headphones and all of my research and support knowledge (I have an IT background) came up empty, so I tried Microsoft support at their official phone number.I spoke to one tech and he remoted in with Quick Assist. Before support began the problem cleared itself up with no further issue, so we disconnected. The issue immediately came back, so I called back and was given to a new tech to reopen the ticket.The new tech, Rohan, also remoted in with Quick Assist. He then went lightning-fast, doing the following:Opened Device manager and disabled my bluetooth deviceLaunched MSDS (Surface diagnostic tool). I am NOT on a Surface device and he did not ask.When MSDS Terms of service popped open, he clicked the \"accept\" button without asking or even saying a wordOpened SysConfig and disabled the first 20 or so programs in the \"services\" tab. This included several Microsoft services.Opened task manager and disabled my entire startup listOpened RegEdit and did SOMETHING. I didn't have more than a second and I couldn't catch what he did before he had closed this and all other windows, and restarted the computer.Which then had issues booting.When it finally got back to the desktop, Rohan asked me to reconnect the support session, but I couldn't--I had an empty system tray, nothing in my internet adapters, everything in \"Services.msc\" was disabled or stopped. Rohan then said that before we continued support I would need to contact my internet provider.I told him that's not the case, and explained that I had just watched him disable all this stuff. Rohan got very angry and started saying I shouldn't blame him for this problem, and that he hadn't done anything wrong. I asked to speak to a manager and Rohan hung up.It has been several hours and I have my PC back up to where it was before Rohan's interaction, but my initial issue remains unsolved and I feel like my trust in Microsoft support has been severely damaged here.
