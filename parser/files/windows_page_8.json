Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check\/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter. Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates. Select Windows Components and open Biometrics. Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature. Reboot your PC. 4) Update drivers If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the version upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished. Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -> Scan for hardware changes. The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 5) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool as shown here:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta... 6) If this was caused by a Version Update then for 10 days you can roll it back in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool which is explained more here:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta....7) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 8) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.9) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... ________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

The program is written in java and originally designed for linux. It works by listening to the internal microphone and depending on some sound conditions, it starts an external exe. The program worked perfectly on linux. It works as well on windows, with a little difference. In fact, it can work for a long time and the only interactions with the user come from the microphone. So when the program is started, everything works well, but after some time, obviously because no user is using the keyboard or the touchpad, windows starts executing background tasks. Theses tasks create a very heavy disk load so that starting the external exe (this lasts normally less than one second) can take up to one minute, making the program unusable. The main process using the disk is named System. I found two workarounds. The first one is to move the cursor with the touchpad from time to time. In this case, the windows background processes do not start and everything works. I changed as well my program in order to simulate an user activity. I simulated pressing and depressing the shift key\u00a0 (by using the Robot class of Java). This seems to be efficient too.Is there a way to control these background windows activity or workload of the system, in order to let application programs start with decent performances, even when the user does not use the keyboard or the touchpad ?Thanks for your help.Marc.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Windows Media Player 12 on Windows 10 Home        Have an irksome little issue that I'm wondering about concerning Media Player.\u00a0 I was doing some housekeeping of music files in my Media Player library, downloaded songs and some tracks that I'd slapped together myself, entering song details etc., and in the middle of doing this, MP stopped allowing me to add pictures to the \"album art\" thumbnail in the songs' entry in the MP library.\u00a0 Usually, you can right-click on the thumb for the track\/album (which is blank if it's a custom track) and will have the option to \"paste album art\" listed among others.\u00a0 Well, that option just disappeared, even if I'd already copied a pic I wanted to use and had it waiting on deck in the clipboard, no joy.\u00a0 As I said, I was in the middle of updating tracks' info and had already done this very thing for a couple of songs.\u00a0 I didn't change any settings for MP - I don't know what happened.\u00a0 Any theories?","solutions":["Hi Pan.
