I know this because of the Microphone icon appears in the tray when I plug it in and disappears when I unplug it. I have NO microphone plugged into my PC at all. I use the audio input to listen to my stereo receiver (mainly LPs) while computing. The sound outputs via my NVidia RTX2070 HDMI High Definition Audio to my monitor which has a soundbar attached via optical. This setup worked flawlessly until recent Windows 10 updates introduced the microphone always on with the icon feature. The blue 3.5mm onboard Realtek HD Audio Input is the only Realtek input\/output port in use. No microphone is plugged into either rear or front (pink) microphone input port. With this new \"microphone\" situation, any website browsed to can activate the microphone (which I don't have as stated). One site of note is Netflix. If I go to one of these sites that wants to activate my microphone (that I don't have):1) my display blacks out for a second, then comes back on with a notification that the site has accessed my microphone.2) my music that I was playing through my Realtek Audio Line In goes silent. From that point on I cannot get my Audio In music to play through my soundbar. The Audio Line In is working because the audio meter in the Sound settings is still pulsing. No reboots nor enabling and disabling Sound settings can get the \"Line In\" sound playing back to the soundbar. System sounds and web site videos can still be heard. Essentially a microphone (that I don't have) event breaks the Line In audio from being \"heard\" from that point on. The only way I have figured to get the ability to hear my receiver on my PC out to my soundbar is to run System Restore to my last restore point. Is there a workaround?

It's a huge invasion of privacy concern. Prior to this addition, I never had a website just simply activate my non-existent microphone on my Desktop PC. I can disable the microphone option in Windows 10, but doing that also disables my Realtek Audio Line In jack. That's just plain crazy!My workaround was to locate a spare headphone with microphone jack and plug that microphone jack into my Realtek \"microphone\" input and mute it via the switch on the headphone cord. Windows 10 recognizes the headphone connection and I set it to \"Default Communications Device\" in the Sound settings. Meanwhile the audio \"Line In\" is also set as \"Default Device\". Now websites try to access my muted unused microphone rather than making Windows 10 break my audio \"line in\"."]},{"symptom":"Possible 1909 issue: Computer Freezing Up After Being Idle For A Certain Amount Of Time        Disclaimer: I'm not technically sure if this is due to 1909 or a program that installed.When i first upgraded to to 1909 last month, it was working perfectly fine and had no problem, however in recent days i've been deeling with a very annoying problem that that the computer would freeze up when its idle for a certain ammount of time (at first It only happened while being idle), but know sometimes even freezes up while you're working on it, or even trying to reinstall Windows 10 through the Media Creation Tool.Not sure what's causing this issue and not quite sure if its a issue due to the 1909 upgrade or due to a program, i installed. At first i thought it was due to the fact that i had both AVG and Avast installed so i uninstalled those programs, it was fine for a few days but then the freezing started up again.Not sure what i can do to resolve this issue, i'm trying everything i can do, but even when i'm trying to reinstall the Windows 10 1909 upgrade through the media creation tool it actually freezes up because it thinks its \"idle\" even though its actively doing something.It's quite annoying where once it freezes up you can't do anything, the only thing you can do is turn it off by pressing the power button.\u00a0Has anyone else had a similar problem where after you upgraded to 1909 your computer constantly freezes up after being idle for a certain amount of time?Thanks in advance,Bryan","solutions":["Hi Bryan.
