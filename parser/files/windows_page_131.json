Even if you've tried a step, please do it over in sequence:Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see. If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:1) Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter from Windows Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.2) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/10164\/....
