However, despite promising that Windows 7 would only have one service pack, Microsoft decided to release a \"convenience rollup\" for Windows 7 in May 2016. This single package combines all previously released updates from the release of SP1 to April 2016. So even though Microsoft isn't calling this a service pack, for all intents and purposes, it serves as one.This article will show you how to install the convenience update (SP2 for Windows 7).\u00a0Note: System Administrators can use DISM to integrate this package into their installation media to simplify future Windows 7 installations.1. PrerequistesBefore installing the convenience update, make sure:You are running Windows 7 SP1You have at least 5 GB of free space available on your system diskYou have installed KB3020369 (download links below)KB3020369 for x64 systemsKB3020369 for x32 systems2. DownloadOnce the prerequisites are met, you can download the convenience update from the links below.Update for x64 systems (477 MB)Update for x32 systems (316 MB)3. InstallWhen the download has finished, double-click the file, and follow the on-screen instructions. This is a large update, so the searching and installation process may take a while. Please be patient.Note: Remember, since Microsoft isn't calling this update a service pack, the version number listed in System Properties will remain Windows 7 SP1.4. Install other Windows UpdatesThe convenience rollup only contains the updates released after Service Pack 1 and before April 2016. Any updates for Windows 7 that Microsoft has released since then will not be installed, so you should run Windows Update to install any other available updates.Also, the convenience update does not include Internet Explorer 11 or the latest .NET Framework Updates. You should install those packages manually or from Windows Update if you need them.\u00a0Happy Patching!Related ArticlesFix: Windows 7 Update stuck on \"Checking for updates\"","solutions":["Ensure is that you are using the latest edition of Internet Explorer which for win 7 is now ie11.","Good.

Hey there everyone,I'm trying to install Voice Attack on my Lenovo Legion Y720 (Core i7-7700K \/ 16GB RAM \/ GTX 1060 6GB etc.), and one of the prerequisites to enabling the proper running of the program is that Windows Speech Recognition is up and running on my system beforehand.\u00a0 To the best of my knowledge I have done everything in my power to get this service up and running, however my\u00a0 system completely refuses to set the microphone up in the first place.I'm running Windows 10 Home (Build 18362.19h1_release.190318-1202), with all updates installed and Windows set to auto-update everything as it comes along, and to make sure I manually checked for updates prior to starting this post.My language and region settings are as follows:Country or Region: AustraliaRegional Format: English (Australia)Windows Display Language: English (Australia)Preferred Language: English (Australia)Speech Language: English (Australia)Option to recognise non-native accents to this language is on.When I then click on the Get Started button to commence set-up of the microphone I am immediately launched into the theSpeech application as it goes into trouble detection mode.\u00a0 I am presented with the options to state that I am unable to hear Cortana (which is false, my headset and laptop speakers both output without issue), or to state that Cortana is unable to hear me (which is also false as both my headset and laptop microphone array are both in working condition).\u00a0 This problem is persistent, even when I change all my regional and language settings over to English (United States) by way of troubleshooting this issue.Furthermore, when I launch into Speech Recognition via the Control Panel, I am advised that \"Windows Speech Recognition is not available for the current display language\".\u00a0 Is there something unusually cryptic and\/or arcane that I have managed to trigger with all of this, or is there an as yet unresolved software glitch giving me grief?Many thanks in advance for assistance rendered.Doug","solutions":["Hi,\u00a0Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.\u00a0We understand the difficulties, you are facing while enabling speech recognition in Windows 10.\u00a0It\u2019s very unusual that speech recognition is available for English Australia but still you are unable to configure.\u00a0However, we would like you to perform these steps and let us know the end result.Press Windows + R key to launch Run command and type control panel, then click Ok.Change the category to large from the top right corner and select Speech Recognition.Click on Advanced Speech Options. Under Microphone click on Audio InputSelect the Playback tab and right click on the headset you use and selectSet as Default Device & Set as Default Communication Device.Now, select the Recording tab and right click on the headset you use and selectSet as Default Device & Set as Default Communication Device.Click Ok.Now, click on Configure Microphone under microphone and set the microphone.If in case you get any error, please provide us the screenshot.\u00a0If the issue still persist, then try creating a new user account as this issue may be due to a profile corruption. Hence, in order to eliminate possibilities, we would suggest you to create a new user account and check.
