As the title suggest, I'd like to know how to adjust cursor behavior when transitioning between monitors.I'm just built my first (2) pc(s), and am trying to set up monitors for them both.pc1 has 2 1080p monitors at 24 and 27 inches. Windows seems to think they are the same size and as a result moving the cursor horizontally from one screen to another results in a change in height, which is slightly annoying.pc2 has a 24in 1080p monitor and a 28 in 2160p one. Windows seems to the 2160p one is physically double the size and will not let my mouse onto the smaller monitor unless I transition from the bottom half of the larger one, which as one can imagine is more frustrating still.Ideally I would like to be able to keep cursor's height (in the real world) when transitioning screens when possible, and when out of range have the cursor \"bumped\" down to the top of the smaller screen. Failing that, I'd like to at least have pc2 behave like pc1, that is to say at least allow screen transition along the entire edge of the bigger screen.Apologies if this isn't the right topic. My thinking is that this is a personalization issue, and I was not able to find one specifically related to displays.Further apologies if this is a \"why didn't you just google (bing?) it\" question. I did try to no avail, mostly due to not knowing what to search for.","solutions":["Hi ATMBot, I am an independent advisor and a Microsoft user like you, and I would be happy to help you out with this.Typically this can be adjusted by right-clicking anywhere on your desktop and selecting \"Display settings\"I assume that under Multiple displays, you are using the setting \"Extend these displays\"You should see the two monitors displayed as rectangles 1 and 2. You can click and drag on these rectangles to place them as your monitors are physically laid out.This affects how the cursor transitions across monitors and I hope this is what you are looking for!The attached image is from this website (specifically Part Six: Display layout), which also has some additional information on using multiple displays:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/21084-multi...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

I do have the displays sitting side by side both physical and virtually. The problem is that their size difference isn't the same physically and virtually.For instance, for my pc2 windows windows seems to think one display is 4x the size of the other with double the height, when in reality the larger is maybe 36% bigger and 17% taller. This results in a very awkward scenario where, as you pointed out I can choose where i'm unable to transition by dragging the smaller screen around, but there will always by 50% of the bigger screen's edge where the cursor cannot transition.For instance currently I have them aligned by the bottom edge with the smaller screen on the left. As it is, the cursor cannot move left from the entire upper half of the larger screen. I would rather it can.Hopefully I have better described my problem. Thanks once more for the reply.","Hi there, Just to verify, on all monitors, is the setting \"Change the size of text, apps and other items\" set to 100%?I'm out of ideas on this one personally, but another expert may have some other ideas!Best wishes for a quick resolution!
