Thank you!","Hi,The deal with an upgrade is that it needs to be run from within Windows.. Just run the setup on the flash drive from within Windows 7.. You might actually be better off to download the most current version of Windows 10..The flash drive may be outdates by a couple of versions..You may not even need your purchased Windows 10 license to do so.. Some people are still getting the free upgrade from 7 to 10.. Providing you are going from Home to Home, or Pro to Pro.. Windows 7 Ultimate will upgrade to Windows 10 Pro..The upgrade will most likely not even ask for your key.. If it does, select \"I Don't have A Key\"..You can always add it later if necessary..","Try doing the update without entering any key.\u00a0 I had a retail version of Win 7 and it upgraded and activated fine. \u00a0Basically, if your Win 7 is activated, it should upgrade to Win 10.\u00a0 Whether or not it activates can be dealt with after the upgrade has completed..","Hi,The deal with an upgrade is that it needs to be run from within Windows..

It then failed with \"Unable to access the System Reserved Partition\" The support sites states this couldbe caused by a lack of space but the discmanager program shows about 80 mb free. It did not give an error code. So stuck again!Cheers Brian","Hi,You will need a lot more than 80MB of free space..You might try a Disk Cleanup..You might also have better luck if you create a Flash Drive, or download as a ISO..You can burn the ISO to DVD or Flash Drive, or run directly from the ISO with a \"Virtual Drive\".. You may see this option when right clicking on the ISO.. The ISO can not be on the OS drive when running with a Virtual Drive though..Things seem to go more smoothly when installing from the downloaded media, as opposed to installing directly from the create media website..","Hi,You will need a lot more than 80MB of free space..You might try a Disk Cleanup..You might also have better luck if you create a Flash Drive, or download as a ISO..You can burn the ISO to DVD or Flash Drive, or run directly from the ISO with a \"Virtual Drive\"..

Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved. Do other BT device work on that computer? Since you did all on that link? 1. Turn Phone and headphones OFF. (leave phone off while trying to connect). 2. Then restart computer. Wait a few for computer to stabilize. Try to connect headphones as Sony says. Does the headset connect to other Windows 10 computers? Only after trying all - turn phone on. ====== ====== Please review ALL of these if the above did not help (if you skip any that is likely to be what needed to be done).Here is my usual troubleshooting guide : Check with the Sony's support. <---- this is key for known issues. Try this : Turn OFF the Bluetooth device. On Computer Start Menu -> Settings -> Devices -> Connected Devices - Add a DeviceHOLD the Power Button on the device for 8+ seconds until the BLUE light starts to flash.Device has entered pairing mode - on computer click \"Search for Devices\" Install or update drivers if needed though Windows 10 will have many. If paired -> Right Click little speaker near clock on lower right -> Playback Devices - set as Default if desired. (You may need to right-click in the box to check Show Disabled and Disconnected devices.)Or Start - type in --> Sound ...... find at top and click on to get to the same Playback tab================================ Start - Settings - Update & Security - Troubleshoot - \"Bluetooth\" and \"Hardware and Devices\" troubleshooters.Check with your System\/Motherboard maker and install the latest Bluetooth Drivers. Ask their support and in their forums about any known issues.Also update the BIOS and chipset drivers while there as they can also affect the Bluetooth operation.=========================== Good idea to update all the major drivers : Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more. http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/driverview.htmlFor Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites. http:\/\/pcsupport.about.com\/od\/driverssupport\/ht...========================================= If the computer currently supports Bluetooth AND the drivers have been updated as indicated above.
