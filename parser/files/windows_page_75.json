Any suggestions?","solutions":["Hi Dharman. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.What MS approved conversion process? The only absolutely stable method I know of to change from MBR to modern UEFI is to enable UEFI in the BIOS, boot the Windows installation media as as a UEFI device, wipe the drive of all partitions to reset the formatting, then click Next to let it auto-create and -format the needed partitions and reinstall. This invoke Windows Boot manager which must remain set to boot first.Any other conversions is going to be dodgy because you're pulling the table cloth out from under Thanksgiving dinner and then trying to replace it with moving or breaking any dishes.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.","In addition to the good explanation that Greg provided, I would like to add a technical distinction:The UEFI is akin to\u00a0firmware while the MBR is a partitioning method. So you would compare the UEFI to the BIOS, and the MBR to the GPT. You wouldn't speak of converting MBR to UEFI.I said that the UEFI is\u00a0akin to firmware, because it's not really firmware. The BIOS really is firmware, because it resides on a chip on the motherboard. But the UEFI is programmable software that sits between the computer\u2019s hardware and the operating system.The only compelling reason to convert your hard drive from MBR to GPT is if you need to have more than 4 primary partitions on the drive. MBR is limited to 4 primary partitions. And then, since GPT can't be run from the BIOS, you would need to use the UEFI.The UEFI has many technical improvements over the BIOS, to be sure, but considering the uncertainty inherent in converting old hardware, there isn't really a good reason to attempt converting from BIOS to UEFI other than the satisfaction in pulling off a complicated maneuver.","Dear Greg,Thanks for your feedback. What you describe has been my understanding for some time, however, in a state of near exhaustion I read in Windows Central and on Microsoft Docs that there was a command line method of converting from Bios to UEFI sans data loss. There is no critical reason for me to convert at this time, but I plan to use UEFI in a future disk installation and so found this odd but interesting if it ideed worked.
