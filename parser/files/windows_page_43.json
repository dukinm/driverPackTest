{"windows":[{"symptom":"Cloning Windows Partition Continues to Fail        Hi All,I got a new system for myself which left me with a spare SSD for my wife. She's dual booting Windows 10 and Linux. The SSD is the same size as her HDD currently in the system. In Linux I ensured that partitions were literally identical running the fdisk command. I'm cloning one partition at a time. The Linux partitions work flawlessly (no surprise....) the Windows partition fails miserably. The clone succeeds but when I reboot I get a blue screen.I do not want to clean install for various reasons. Unlike Linux which takes 20 minutes to install, Windows takes hours and always has a series of problems along the way. Additionally, I'm not even sure I have the install media any more as the system is a few years old and I've moved and may have misplaced the original install dvds. Finally, the system is set up in a very specific way including backup scripts, mount points, specific software doing specific things at specific times. Starting from scratch is not an option.Does anyone have any suggestions on how I might get this clone to work right for the Windows partition? I knew this would be a nightmare but so far I'm 5 days into efforts and just failure after failure. It's amazing that Linux worked on first try while Windows fails with an identical copied partition . . .Thanks.","solutions":["Hello, my name is Arif Ahmed, Windows Advisor. I would be happy to help you. Please try the following cloning method. 1. Click \u201cStart\u201d and type \u201ccmd\u201d. Right click on cmd and select \u201cRun as administrator\u201d.2. Type xcopy c:\\ f:\\ \/s \/e \/h \/i \/c \/y and press Enter to copy all the files and subdirectories (including any empty subdirectories, any system or hidden files) from drive C to drive F. You may change the drive letters according to your own needs.(Here F:\/ is the destination partition) If above method does not work and shows the same error, there might be some issue and you may need to Reset the PC.If you do not wish to reinstall the OS, you may go for System Reset with the option \"Remove Everything\". This will be equivalent to clean installation."]},{"symptom":"app error        how do i correct this error on windows 10.\u00a0 It only comes up when I am trying to open my wordpress site or wp-admin?this file does not have an app associated with it for performing this action.
