So i plugged in my windows 10 usb installation usb drive and booted off of that. While in the installation process I used diskpart in command prompt to conpletely clean my hdd, which had windows 10 installed on it. I then proceeded with the dowbload for the ssd and finally got to the setup screens and everything was going well until i got onto the network screen, i sat there for about 30 minutes and nothing popped up. I have an ethernet connection with my router and the network was working fine on my old instance of Windows 10, but i ended up pressing skip this step, thinking that i could do it later. Next was supposed to be the microsoft account login, but i guess because of no internet connection I couldn't login and was told to put in my name. I put in my password and finished the setup but was brought to my desktop with no internet connection and no access to my microsoft account. I have tried many different ways to get my network to connect, but nothing has worked yet. I've even booted back up off of the Windows 10 usb and wiped my ssd, thinking that I could just go back to Windows 10 on my hdd. I went through the setup until the network screen and was left disconnected on my hdd instance of Windows 10. I cannot figure out whats happening and have been trying to fix ny computer for days. Whenever I do the network troubleshoot it says that Windows did not detect a properly installed network adapter. My specs on my computer are an Intel 17 9700k, an NVidia GTX 1060 6gb, 16 gigs of ddr4 ram, and of course my 1tb hdd and 1tb ssd.","solutions":["Hi, I'm David an independent advisor and user just like you. I'll do my best to help you with this.Windows 10 comes with a great many drivers built-in to the install file - and in the majority of cases will identify and install your network card driver automatically. However it sounds like, for whatever reason, it hasn't been able to identify your network driver in this case. If you were to look in Device Manager (right-click START, choose Device Manager) you might find you have one or more \"unknown\" devices listed - one of which will likely be your network device.There are a couple of options: 1. If the computer is a custom-build gaming type machine you might have some original installation CDs - if you have one for your motherboard it will contain drivers for your network device.2. If you know the make\/model of your mainboard and you can use a different computer to download the required drivers to a USB device and then install them on the problem PC.3. Get a USB plug-in network adapter - generally these either come with a built-in driver so work automatically or will have their own driver CD you'd need to install. that would get you online. Once you are online Window will likely be able to download the drivers for your original network device!

The file sharing protocol used for network file sharing (SMB) is highly insecure and not recommended for over-the-internet use without encryption. Some internet service providers block this port as it can be exploited to spread malware. Business typically use a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to share files over the internet.I would suggest that if you or someone at your work does not have the expertise to set this up, that you explore using a service like OneDrive to put this folder on, and the files will then be available from wherever you have an internet connection, and in a secure manner. Is there something specific you do not like about OneDrive? There is a desktop app to allow the files to sync to the local machine, and it is also accessible over a website interface.-Ashton","Ashton,Initially that is what I was going to do, use OneDrive however, then I found out that I could not save and use QuickBooks file to a virtual drive so that kind of messed things up for my plan.In the office, we just plug out pc's into the same router and make the connection and no problems however, if I want to access my files (specifically quickbooks) while on the road, it's a problem.\u00a0So I checked with quickbooks and they suggest QuickBooks online, which is their web based solution but, I already own and just upgraded to latest version. Also, I didn't want to be dependant on a life long subscription to quickbooks just to access my financial information.\u00a0The other issue I have is sync on OneDrive - if I setup my desktop to use OneDrive under my MS account, it sync's everything in my OneDrive folder (as it should) however, if I log into my MS account with my laptop on the road, it also sync's everything in the local OneDrive folder on the laptop.\u00a0 Since the desktop has to be on in order for me to access files remotely, I worry that making changes on the laptop with trickle over to the desktop prematurely.

Let it scan the whole drive for any errors and then Reboot your computer to check if it has fixed the Blue Screen of Death Error.3] Checking hardware for physical issues Sometimes, faulty hardware can also result in the software driver not working properly. We would recommend checking the internal components of the CPU for any issues. These issues are not only caused when the device encounters physical damage but can also be caused due to voltage fluctuations and short circuits. You may also want to run ChkDsk. You could run a command like the following to check and repair disk errors on your C drive:chkdsk c: \/f \/r 4] Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool. Click on Start, type in mdsched.exe and allow the tool to check your computer memory (RAM) for problems.5] Update your BIOS and drivers. BIOS updates can be found on your manufacturer\u2019s website, and driver updates can either be done manually through Device Manager (use Start Search to find it)6] If on a laptop, change power settings to High Performance. 7] If this problem occurs shortly after installing a new program, remove that program right away.Give me news. ;-) Marco _________________________________________________ Note: Il y a des liens vers des sites Web autres que Microsoft.
