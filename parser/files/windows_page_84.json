I have a client who requires the use of a wireless bluetooth headset as his PC is too far for wired. While other wireless headphone options exist using Bluetooth enables him to also use the headset with his phone and is less expensive. He uses Team Speak 3 (TS3) while gaming to talk with gaming friends (OK, yes I am one of those friends too) so having the audio cut out while TS3 is running is a serious problem. However, this is not a TS3 problem as the audio cuts out when any app in Windows 10 activates the microphone. Like for example opening the sound control panel and switching to the recording tab will mute audio as the microphone is activated to show level inputs. I found that out because I went to the sound control panel to access the Communications tab and make sure the option there was set to \"Do nothing\".As far as I can see this has been an issue for a long time but I have been unable to find a fix in my online searches for the issue.In my attempts to figure out this problem I have used a few different headsets to rule out the headset. They work perfectly fine linked to a phone, you can hear audio while the mic is active, just not in Windows 10! While the microphone is inactive (no apps using it) the headsets can play audio from multiple apps no problem.I have tried using a Bluetooth 4.0 and 5.0 dongle, same issue for both so I do not think the Bluetooth version is the cause.It seems as though the \"Mute all other sounds\" option from the sound control panel cummunications tab is hard coded for Bluetooth!Has anyone managed to fix this issue, if so; how?","solutions":["rrSo why is it when I switch to recording tab, my music\/ audio mutes?\u00a0 When I set my headset to be both default and communications device, it does not mute.\u00a0\u00a0","If you look you can see it shows a live level bar of the inputs from all enabled devices, so it is accessing the device even though you do not have it selected.

In mid - late December 2019 I noticed a lag in starting applications after booting (or powering up) my Windows 10 desktop. Outlook, Word, Excel, and others has a noticeable delay in starting. Once I noticed this behavior I started task manager and noticed a process named 'System' running consistently at a CPU rate of 15 - 17%. No matter how long the system was running, even with no active applications started or idle, the CPU rate never changed for this 'System' process. I've watched task manager before and have never had a process 'System' running at this rate. Normally when present this 'System' process runs at around 0.2 - 0.4% CPU.I selected 'System' looked at properties and it is the 'ntoskrnl' process. Next, I went to Micorosoft technet and forums looking for information related to this issue. And, of course, I found a plethora of questions, discussions, etc., all involving ntoskrnl and high cpu utilization, some dating back to 2016. I followed the ones posting in 2019 and tried all the suggestions for fixing this issue. Uninstall this, remove that, kill items in startup, perform a clean boot, check registry and change this, etc., etc., etc.. Non of these worked. I returned the system to the current configuration I've been running for 3 years. Here is what I noticed: If I rebooted\u00a0 (selected 'Restart'), the system rebooted and the 'System' process aka 'ntoskrnl' process was running at 0.2 - 0.4 CPU rate, after about 20 -30 seconds. If I 'shut down' the system to a power off state and then start the system up there is always the 'ntoskrnl' running at the high CPU rate - forever. Perform a reboot (even an immediate reboot) then 'ntoskrnl' is running at the normal 0.2 - 0.4% CPU rate. And there is no lag in starting Outlook or Word or Excel, or etc. The system is back to running normal performance only after a reboot.So why is ntoskrnl having the aberrant behavior? Please help by looking into this. This issue with ntoskrnl keeps resurfacing and Microsoft has not fixed this.Here is my system information- Windows 10 Pro 64 bit, 16GB RAM, Intel i7-6700T CPU, 512GB SSD, all updates current as of Jan 3 2020Two suspicious updates:1)\u00a0 December 10, 2019-KB4533002 Cumulative Update for .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.8 for Windows 10 Version 1903 and Windows Server 1903 RTM and Windows 10, version 1909 and Windows Server, version 19092) December 10, 2019\u2014KB4530684 (OS Builds 18362.535 and 18363.535)The ntoskrnl properties lists the following: Created Wednesday Dec 11, 2019, Location C:\\Windows\\System32 - this incredibly suspicious because this is the same time frame that I noticed the system behaving differently.

Apparently that is not allowed because now when I connect the controller with that cable it gives me a message that says \"The last USB device you connected to this computer malfunctioned, and Windows does not recognize it.\"I tried lots of other cables, they all either display this error or simply don't read at all, except for one that works fine. The problem is that this cable is short and has a weak connection, so I play with it for now but sometimes I will tap it lightly mid game and it will become temporarily disconnected, and the game only works with controllers that are connected before it's launched, so then I immediately lose that game because I no longer have a controller. It's insanely frustrating.What can I do to make my original Micro USB cable connect my XBOX one to my PC, or one of the dozens of other Micro USB cables I have that don't work?","solutions":["Hi JPP6, There's a lot of things to consider in regards to your issue.

After automatic reboot of the laptop, my external hard drive WD MyBook (exFAT) became not writable and a new drive letter was assigned to it (G instead of E). I can read any files on the drive but can\u2019t write anything.Everytime I plug the MyBook to the zenbook, Windows now detects a hard disk problem.I thought about permissions issues. But in the MyBook hard drive properties, there\u2019s no Security tab. So no way to modify the permissions.I used Disk management tool to assign a new drive letter to the MyBook (E). But it\u2019s still write protected.I used DiskPart command to check the disk attributes: both \u2018current read-only state\u2019 and \u2018read-only\u2019 display \u2018No\u2019.
