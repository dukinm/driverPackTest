It seems to me, that Windows is either disconnecting WIFI while shutting down (if no HTTP) or it is disconnecting WIFI while booting after getting no HTTP connection. WIFI connection password stays stored in Windows sessiong, so i don't have to type it in again, but since this PC is not supposed to have HTTP connectivity and not all Users do know what to do, it is very annoying.I hope you can help me in this matter.","solutions":["Hi, poiuztre My name is Jeffrey and I am an Independent Advisor. I would be happy to help you today.Try to follow these steps to repair your Internet connections: Enter the Start menu or by pressing the Win + I key combination, open the Settings and click on the Network and Internet option. Once there, we select the Status option from the menu on the left side and, within the configurations and options that are loaded in the right panel, we have to look for the restoration of the network.

Please perform the following steps: 1. Reset the Network Driver: Go to Device Manager Locate and expand Network Adapter Right click on the Wireless Driver and select Uninstall (Do Not click on any check box)Restart the PC. Connect to the WiFi Network using the Notification Center (Bottom-Right corner) * This time click on the Check box that says \"Connect Automatically\"","So, i've found out that as long i deny external connection to *.deploy.static.akamaitechnologies.com hosts (many hosts&subnets for Windows Update or something like that), the WIFI Connection is shown as \"Connected, No Internet\" and after reboot WIFI is disconnected.If i allow connections to that domain, WIFI connection is shown as \"Connected, Internet\" (in german so it might be not precise, but you get the point), then there are no problems at all.Microsoft - please check this matter, because i'll rather migrate that business branch subnet to linux than give it internet connectivity."]},{"symptom":"Internet and Network issues in Windows 10        I have a problem that I find hard to explain, even to myself and never encountered before. First, this is fairly a new build, April 2019 build. Everything is working fantastic except internet issues. I can\u2019t tell if this problem has been always there but I haven\u2019t noticed it or it just happened recently.Lately I have been noticing my performance in PVP games dropped noticeably, Internet is slow and I can\u2019t seem to land my shots precisely even thought my aim is good, I played around 50 PVP matches and it is quite obvious that something is wrong, the ping is around 4ms. I\u2019m running Fiber Optics 100Mbps and it is stable. Here\u2019s the creepy part: I have three phones and a laptop. I have tested internet speed on all of them and I register full speed on both download and Upload, However on my PC, every time i do a speed test, the page acts weird, the pin does not move as it should, it freezes for like 5 seconds and then it jumps to 20Mbps then down to 12 to 15 Mbps. It gives the results very fast in weird like reading, its like the page is frozen, it doesn\u2019t even calculate the upload speed it just crashes and then the whole page goes black and I can\u2019t open other pages, but other software like Discord and twitch still running and have internet access.The router is working perfectly, I have tested the Ethernet cable I use on my PC, I plugged it to my laptop and I got full speed and everything works just great, that means the cable isn\u2019t the problem I have tested it over laptop\u2019s wifi as well, works great, my phones registered full speed as well.
