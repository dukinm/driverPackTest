{"windows":[{"symptom":"Windows 10 October 2019 Update messes up Chrome Browser        My computer just updated to the newest version yesterday. It is Version 10.0.17763 Build 17763. Right after that when I tried to use the Chrome Browser I started getting slow responses loading pages with a message on the bottom of the page saying \" establishing secure connection\". Some pages would finally load, others just kept spinning. Very frustrating. I tried reinstalling chrome, changing network adapter protocols, nothing worked. I have an AMD FX processor with Radeon graphics card. Many people seem to be having the same problem. I finally got it fixed by visiting different forums. I had to go to services, then scroll to cryptographic services and change to local network. I did this as an administrator when opening the services plug-in. All pages load fast now. My problem is that just now I went to log into services, as an administrator, and it said I was blocked for my protection. How can I get back into the services app? I am the one who changed it, why would I now be blocked? I am so upset. First, the update should never have been released with it messing up Chrome that badly. Second I went to answers on the\u00a0 Microsoft forum and only users gave the fix, not the administrators. Now I am locked out of my services app. What if I need to change something else? Oh yea, and it took me all of last night and 4 hours today to fix it because I was afraid to change the setting. Some people said changing the service to local network would affect updates in the future. I finally did change it because I was so frustrated with my chrome not working. How can I get back into my services app now that it blocks me? I right clicked run as administrator and still am blocked.

I will do my best to help you.First, look at the physical buttons that are directly on your screen. You can probably adjust the edges in the options.Otherwise, if you have an nvidia video card, right click in the empty space in the office, and go to \"nvidia control panel\". Then click on \"Adjust desktop size and position\" under the \"display\" menuFor AMD Radeon Settings > Display > HDMI Scaling\u00a0For Intel this is under, Intel HD Grahpics Control Panel > General Settings > Display > Customize Aspect Ratio under Scaling\""]},{"symptom":"Snip & Sketch reports error notification \"Something Went Wrong\" when attempting to save image as a file        Snip & Sketch App says \"Something went wrong\"When using the Microsft Windows 10 app named Snip & Sketch. Every time I would select an image and attempt to save the image as a file. I would click the icon to save to file and I would get a notification that reads \"Something Went Wrong.\" And the app would not allow me to save the image into a file for later use.I searched the web and couldn't find the fix. So I began searching my computers app options. And I found the fix.Here is an image the Snip & Sketch notification error. The error appears once you have clicked the save icon which is the icon of the floppy disc.THE FIX: Open your SETTINGS then choose APPS. Under the APPS & FEATURES option scroll down to your SNIP & SKETCH app. Select and click the app. There will be a small drop-down menu with two options; (1) Advanced Options (2) Uninstall. Choose (1) Advanced Options.After clicking the advanced options link. You will be viewing the advanced options of the snip & sketch application. (Image below). Under the header that reads APP PERMISSIONS. There is an option named PICTURES that has an on and off switch located beneath the word pictures. You need to click that button and turn the option on.Once you have turned on that advanced app option. You will now be able to save a clipped image into a file.I hope this helps somebody out there in the web. Best wishes!","solutions":["This almost worked... it gave me the clue I needed...
