New Year greetings to you."]},{"symptom":"Device attempts to connect to all UNKNOWN and KNOWN networks within range via \"connect automatically\"        First off, this is NOT an issue with KNOWN NETWORKS. I have looked and looked on the community and every time someone asks this question advice is given for known networks.The \"connect automatically\" box remains checked for every network in range whether it is a KNOWN OR UNKNOWN network.\u00a0This is keeping my device from automatically connecting to the known network I want to connect to as it attempts to connect to every other UNKNOWN NETWORK within range.I can manually un-check every single box from the \"view available networks\" panel, close the panel, then reopen it just to find that every box is checked again.I have un-installed my wireless device drivers and reinstalled them, I have completely reset all my network connection settings.\u00a0I have completely cleared all known networks yet still the issue persists.\u00a0I am running windows 10 on a Toshiba however this issue seems to impact all machines\u00a0Thanks","solutions":["Perhaps it will help to understand that 'Connect automatically' means to connect without being prompted for a password.For example, you choose (click on) the network to which you want to connect, and are then connected immediately, without first being prompted for the network's password. Since this is a convenience, all networks are checked.However, you can only connect automatically if the network's password is stored in your computer.\u00a0Otherwise, you'll need to enter the network's password, i.e., you can't connect automatically.","Hi dbristerMy name is Jon and I am an independent technical adviser. Sorry to hear you are experiencing issues and I would really like to help you find a resolution.Have you tried to remove all wifi networks from the registry?Open the registry editor. You need to press Win+R, type regedit and click OK.Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\NetworkList\\Profiles\\Check the ProfileName value in each subkey under Profiles and find the key related to the Wi-Fi network profile you want to delete.Right-click it and select Delete to delete a whole registry key. In such a way you will remove all information about a certain wireless network and make your PC really \u2018forget\u2019 everything about it.Hope this helps.Jon.","Hi, thank you for your response.I did some more research and it agrees with your answer. Apparently, windows sets connect automatically to be a default option on password protected networks but not checked as default on open networks in the available networks panel. (basically it's \"pre-checked\" in the chance the user wants to connect to that network)This somewhat eliminates my security concerns but I am still having issues with my machine automatically connecting to my home known network.I'm beginning to think there is another issue causing connection issues to my known network rather than it attempting to connect to other unknown networks.\u00a0Thanks again","Hi Jon,I checked the registry values you suggested and the only network listed under the profiles is my home network.\u00a0The issue appears to be a misunderstanding on my part of how the connect automatically feature is written for the GUI.It seems the \"connect automatically\" box is checked by default for all password protected networks to save clicks on the users end.\u00a0I may have a different unknown issue as to why I am having issues automatically connecting to my home network.\u00a0Thank you very much for your response.\u00a0","Thanks for your response.
