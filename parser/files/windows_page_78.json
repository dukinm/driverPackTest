I\u00b4m usually able to solve this things by myself, but not this time.This is the thing. My Windows 10 started to randomly slow down some months ago. That\u00b4s basically it. It didn\u00b4t get better after rebooting, and a year had passed since the last Windows install, so I did a clean installation. But still the same problem, even after the first rebooting - and no extra software installed. I thought it was the updates, so I stopped them. But nothing. Same after a new installation with full updates. A third attempt at a clean install was directed to find a driver conflict. I learned that Windows was wrongly updating some drivers, so I stopped that, and installed the correct drivers everywhere. Still the same. I checked the HD health with some software I don\u00b4t remember: it was fine; as a matter of fact, the only task that is not slowed down is HD writing: I can copy or download files at normal speed, but everything else, including opening the start menu, is slowed to turtle speed. I use Avira antivirus, and checked for malware with Malware bytes; also nothing. I also checked the event viewer, but there are of course many errors there, and I can\u00b4t identify which could be relevant, even focusing on those that occurred when the slowing starts. Also, the\u00a0usage of resources looks fine during the event: CPU usually under 10% in idle, an doesn\u00b4t go up 25% in activity; RAM usage is normally under 30%, and HD at 1%.I got out of ideas, and let it be. The system eventually returns to normal, usually after a couple hours. And after some weeks, the thing just went away for months, but now it came back.Despite the general uncertainty of it all, I have been able to identify what seem to be (maybe) triggers of the event: sometimes it happens when the system goes into suspension; recently, plugging\/unplugging the AC charger seems to be the main trigger, though it doesn\u00b4t happen everytime.Some facts: the computer is a Dell Inspiron laptop, 7000 series. CPU: i7-7500U GPU: Intel 620.If someone has any idea, I\u00b4ll be happy to read it.Thanks in advance,N","solutions":["Hi Nicolas, You might want to check these suggested steps on how to improve performance of your Windows 10 Operating System:https:\/\/www.windowscentral.com\/15-tips-increase...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

Since I found a solution that worked for me, I figured I would sum it up for anyone else having the same problem.If you are having memory_management BSODs on a new PC, I would highly recommend trying these steps before replacing your RAM. It may not actually be because your RAM is faulty, and this will save you a lot of trouble if it works.(Optional) Update your motherboard's BIOS. I don't think you have to do this step for this solution to work, but I did it before doing the next steps and it may have contributed towards fixing the problem.Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool. I just did a basic test with one pass. If you get any errors, then updating the BIOS didn't fix the issue.Reboot your computer and go into EUFI setup (F2 on my motherboard)Check and change the voltage that is being supplied to your RAM. You will need to look up the recommended voltage for the RAM you have. Mine was supposed to run at 1.35 V, and my motherboard was only supplying 1.2 V. This is what ended up fixing the blue screens for me.(Recommended) Make sure that your motherboard is running your RAM at the proper MHz. Mine was running at 2400 MHz instead of the 3200 MHz my RAM actually supports. After increasing the voltage, I was getting a lot of lag spikes. Changing the MHz that my RAM was running at fixed that issue.After doing those steps, run the Memory Diagnostic Tool again. If you don't get any errors, the BSODs should be fixed.If you are still getting errors when running the Diagnostic Tool after doing the above steps, it is probably because of faulty RAM. I would try getting it replaced and see if that fixes the issue.Those are all the steps I followed that fixed the memory_management BSOD for me. Hopefully, it also works for you.Below is my original post:I just built a new computer the other day. It is my first custom build, so I was very excited to have it done. Everything went well for the first few hours of use, but then I encountered a blue screen. I thought maybe it was just a one-time thing, but over the past few days, they have become more and more common, to the point that they now occur almost every 5 minutes. There are a few different BSODs that I keep getting over and over:pfn_list_corruptirql_not_less_or_equalsystem_service_exceptionmemory_managementOf the four, system_service_exception is by far the most common, and memory_management is a new one that just happened for the first time a few minutes ago. I have tried everything to fix these, including making sure I have all my drivers up to date, making sure I have completely updated windows, factory resetting windows, and even completely wiping the HDD and SSD and reinstalling Windows from scratch, but none of this seems to stop them from happening. The one thing I haven't tried yet is updating my motherboard's BIOS. Would doing that potentially fix these problems or not?One other thing that might be helpful to know: I am currently running the Windows Memory Diagnostics Tool since I read that I should try it to diagnose these blue screens, and it says \"Hardware problems were detected. To identify and repair these problems, you will need to contact the computer manufacturer.\" Does this mean there could be an issue with my RAM or one of my hard drives?I would greatly appreciate any help that can be provided since I have no idea what to do at this point to fix it. Nothing I've found online to try seems to have worked.","solutions":["I was going to suggest a bios update, check the motherboard manufacturers website and see the reason for the latest update.

At this point I'm assuming it probably has something to do with my hardware, because I don't know what else to fix as far as software goes.","Hello EJP619, I am Andrew, I want to try to help you more.

After my previous memory management BSOD, I ran the chkdsk\/r command in command prompt since I read online that it was a potential fix for that BSOD. I have since then not gotten any more BSODs after over an hour and a half of use, which is good considering they were happening every 5-10 minutes. Maybe this fixed the problem, but I can't tell for sure yet. If I do get another BSOD though, I will make sure to follow the steps you provided. For now though, I am just going to use the computer normally and see what happens.Edit: Also, I have already restored the BIOS to the defaults after I did the BIOS update before. I have also checked several times to make sure I have all the updated drivers installed for all my components, so I don't think that is contributing to the issue.","Awesome, I'm excited to hear this has worked out for you so far.
