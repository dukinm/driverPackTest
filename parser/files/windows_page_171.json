Sometimes signing in to individual apps like Xbox with a Local Account will convert it to a MS Account if you mistakenly choose the wrong thing.So go into Settings > Accounts > Your Info to see if it's got the wrong account you don't want as Windows 10 account. If so choose the link to Sign in with a Local Account Instead, let it convert to Local.Then if you want the correct MS Account as your Windows 10 account, restart PC and go back to the same location to \"Sign in with a MS Account instead\" and sign in with the correct MS Account.If you want to keep the Local Account then watch that it doesn't prompt you with tricky choices meant to convert the Local Account to a MS account, and if you do make sure it's the one you want. This annoys a lot of people.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.

Merged.Is it possible to disable the popup list of input languages at the bottom right corner when having + pressed in Windows 10 version 1903?I do not want to disable the + hotkey (or + for that matter) or the ability to switch languages; I\u00a0just want to switch offthis popup that was introduced in build1903.I've tried turning off the language indicator.\u00a0 The indicator turns off, the popup stays.To add insult to injury, the popup often appears when I'm not even going to change the input language.\u00a0 E.g., I'm editing text in a text editor, actively using and to select and move blocks of text, and the language popup keeps appearing._______________________________________________Until we find a solution>If I am pressing Shift first - the popup doesn't appear at all.But it is NOT a fix, it is just a temporary solution that doesn'tmakes it UNNECESSARY to find the way to switch off it completely!!!! __________________________________________________This is repost from superuser.com","seems no one knows the answer, neither microsoft itself.and they don't care to fix the trashy thing they do....","Tried MSDN Forum - but even there no answers what so ever!MSDN Mobile Apps Forum seems doesn't exist at all....Anyways about Windows 10 latestpopup sh....t (sorry can't call that stuff some other way,because it is fricking annoying, unnecessary, and enforced,destroys my working space dramatically!!!!)Some sick-heads could come up with idea to make it popping upwithout possibility to switch it off!Anyways -\u00a0 the point is (again) - no answers what so ever...","The pop-up window makes it possible to select the input language you want. HoldingAlt and tapping left Shift (or holding Winkey and tapping the spacebar) cycles through the installed languages.If you prefer not to see the pop-up, assign a Ctrl-Shift-n shortcut to each language and use that instead: Settings\u00a0 > Devices > Typing | More keyboard settings > Advanced keyboard settings > Input language hot keys.","Hello!Thank you for answer, but it is not a solution!To have to switch between languages and to add the third key for every switch isextremely ridiculous!\u00a0It wouldn't really work even with 2 languages because it slows all work,but with 5 that I use it is just doesn't work at all.First of all this popup window doesn't make possible to select input languagebut makes it more obvious what language is chosen as it a huge window that pops up\u00a0 on the side of the screen,and in previous versions it could be controlled if I want to see it or not,thou the functionality of the Alt+Shift was the same,now the so called developers that seems are underaged and not very smart people are makingit forced thru the convenient key sequence without the possibility to turn it off.We used Alt+Shift to cycle thru the languages in decades without needing this annoying popup stuffbut now all of a sudden they decided that flickering window is good for my eyes and good mood...There is not enough bad words to actually use to name all those so called developers....The only thing needed is to be able to use option to switch this popup off, but instead of making itthey just making people angry, irritated and sad.... and want to hate them for the way theytreat their customers...So thank you for your answer but it is not a real solution...I wait for some either registry trick or a real fix where I'll be able to work normally as I did before...Hope more angry customers write actively so that hopefully they fix stuff they broke!!!","... it is not a solution!... to add the third key for every switch is\u00a0extremely ridiculous!\u00a0It wouldn't really work even with 2 languages because it slows all work, but with 5 that I use it is just doesn't work at all.If you have configured five input languages, A, B, C, D and E, and you are currently typing in language A, how do you switch to using language E? If you set up a hotkey, say Ctrl-Shift-5 for E, that is a single keystroke to switch.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure why you say 'it wouldn't work with 2 languages\u00a0because it slows all work;' it takes no more time to type Ctrl-Shift-2 than to type Alt-Shift.\u00a0\u00a0... this popup window doesn't make possible to select input language ...Are you saying that if you press Winkey and tap the spacebar, you don't see the selection in the pop-up list change? If that is the case, there's something wrong with your installation.\u00a0\u00a0... it a huge window that pops up\u00a0 on the side of the screen,I suppose that depends on your definition of huge. It seems to be the same width as the start menu, with each language occupying about the same height as the taskbar.\u00a0","OK!First - to switch between languages I just holding Alt and fast clicking shift x time to switch to desired language.it is much faster as it takes only 2 fingers to do it and I don't need to see what I switch cause I know exactly what number of times I have to clickto get to needed language.And I DON'T need to look on the keyboard to do it but in case of adding extra key especially with numbers I'll need to interrupt normal pace of typing and see what button to push...\u00a0besides use another hand to push the extra button.And yeas pressing Ctrl+Shift+2 takes extra time as I need to use 2 hands or uncomfortable move my wrist to push those buttons. - Alt+Sift is the same movement that you can do repeatedly to switch between languages and basically it automatically made movement + MUCH more ergonomic. Second - I see the selection in the pop-up list, but it is not a \"thing that makes possible to switch between languages\" BUT it just makes it more visible and it may be good for those who uses computer seldom and\/or completely unprofessionally.....So it is not necessary thing, especially it was completely functional without this HUGE popup.And for the last about HUGE - it is very good definition as with 6 languages it is gigantic and event with 2 languages it flickers and destroyspeoples normal working process...I want as little things as possible that distracting on my workplace (screen) and THIS unnecessary thing only distracts and irritates eyes...(Even windows 10 start menu is disaster as it takes lots of place and very badly adjustable with all those big icons that are good onlyfor kids and may be for some older people - lots of people use Classic Shell to get back menu that looks like in windows 7 - compact and smallicons so we don't need to do long scrolling till we come to the end of the list)And Again the thing is that we lived very well without this trash - I'm sorry bur I can't call it other words because the great thing with windowswas the possibility to adjust things as it was comfortable and ergonomic for the individual work,but now it seems that windows becoming less and less adjustable just because it seems that developers now are some underaged teenagers that destroying functionality.It is not that difficult to add possibility to switch off this thing so that we don't need to change hotkey routine that thousands of people are used to..\u00a0There is many that reported irritation with this popup window and still there is no fix for it...Not even some registry tweak and this really sucks!!!!","This is what I mean HUGE if someone still doubts!!!! (this was before I needed to add one more language, so now it even bigger)!!!and as I need to switch fast between few languages during the chat sessions,and when I typing in few documents switching between languagesall extra button combinations are extremely distracting, besides as we used to use this combinationwithout stuff popping up this window should be assigned to the other hotkeys or made possible tocompletely switch off for thousands of users that don't want to see this trash..."]},{"symptom":"I have activated Windows 10 Home, but my pc still asks for the update        I have activated Windows 10 Home with digital license, but for some reason I am still constantly asked to update to Windows 10 (version 1903).
