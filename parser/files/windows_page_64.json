As I have no idea what type of System image you have used I can't advise you specfics on it. Windows imaging is very limited and will restore to the same offset (position) on the drive, if it will even restore to a different sized drive. This is why all experts prefer free Macrium which is adaptable and easier to use, will adjust partition sizes smartly during the process.If it's factory recovery disks you created then those contain all of the bloatware which will always make WIndows slower and cause issues.If the image will restore the drive, then you can try to adjust the partition sizes using Disk management or a partition manager. If you want me to advise you then post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays. Follow the steps here so I can see everything we need to advise you: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/foru... I'm not sure why you think a larger drive will be faster.

So unless the image is corrupted or doesn't install well, it should be adjustable to run better if that's necessary.Personally I would invest in the Clean Install above since it's one of life's great learning experiences that will permanently make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to keep it that way.

Sometimes my computer gets hung up in restart as well and i have to cold reboot it.\u00a0Is there any way to get these updates to install, especially without having these restart issues? When I go to \"check for updates\" it tell me I am up to date...","solutions":["HI Nicole. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I would manually upgrade to the latest version 1909 by opening the Media Creation Tool from this link:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m..., choose Download Tool Now, then open the tool and choose Upgrade This PC Now. This saves your files, apps and most settings in place, is the most stable method to change versions, brings your Updates current, resolves most problems. If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... If the Version has problems I will work with you to try to resolve them. If the problems are unfixable for now, you have ten days to roll it back in Recovery settings. You can then hide it so it doesn't try to reinstall following this same method:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta... Most problems are resolved by doing this gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... . So read it over and see if its something you want to learn to do.If after Upgrade you still have the BIOS problem reset the BIOS to defaults after taking note of your settings for UEFI, CSM, Legacy BIOS, Secure and Fast Boot and Boot Priority Order. See how here:https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/reset-pc-bios-...I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you will wait to rate my post, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

I tried the first option in this list and I got an error:0xC1900101 - 0x2000DThe installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during the MIGRATE_DATA operationI am a bit nervous to do too much restarting of my computer with OS installation because my monitors do not become responsive until the log-in screen. I do not see any ASUS window or any screens with any quick keys (like F8 to start safe mode for example) at all. My monitors only become responsive at the log in screen after the computer has started up completely, where I put my password in to get into Windows.Can I get some advice on this?\u00a0","Is this a laptop?

What about when there is only one monitor?1) Try resetting the BIOS\/UEFI firmware to default in Setup: https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/reset-pc-bios-...http:\/\/www.isunshare.com\/windows-password\/four-...First take note of the settings for UEFI (should be enabled), CSM or Legacy BIOS (should be disabled), Secure and Fast Boot, and Boot Priority Order.2) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS\/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.If this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here:http:\/\/www.intel.com\/content\/www\/us\/en\/support\/... or the Nvidia Update utility here: http:\/\/www.nvidia.com\/Download\/Scan.aspx?lang=e... or the AMD autodect utility here: http:\/\/support.amd.com\/us\/gpudownload\/windows\/P... For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device > Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.You can also try older drivers in Device Manager > Display device > Driver tab > Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick.Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.Adjust the screen resolution until it fits and looks best at Settings > System > Display.3) Is the Motherboard within a year of purchase, so you can get Asus Support on it?"]},{"symptom":"Windows Defender Browser Protection        Hello...Windows\u00a0 Defender Browser Protection gives this error since google update that changed how adblockers work.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Problems updating to windows 10        When updating to windows 10 the computer bogs down and screen flashes on and off repeatedly.\u00a0 Nothing can be done on the computer to stop it.\u00a0 Restarting the computer results in the same problem.","solutions":["Hi, Tracywoody789 My name is Jeffrey and I am an Independent Advisor.
