You should also X-post on the Steam community forum for the TR games which don\u2019t work with the controller.","i will try the DS4 windows controller but its weird how tomb raider 1 is working fine with the controller but tomb raider 2 and 3 aren't, i will inform you how things go when i give DS4 window link a go","my compute said DS4 window can be risky, but my windows defender said there is no threats, so is it really safe?","I use this & have had no problems from Defender nor Malwarebytes. I\u2019ve found this from Steam: Try disabling the Steam Overlay for the game. (right-click on the game in your Library list, select Properties, then un-check the option for \"Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game\")The Steam Overlay does not work properly with these old Tomb Raider games (which use an old DirectX version). This apparently prevents Steam from using the game-specific controller configuration, and may instead cause the game to respond to Steam's \"Desktop Configuration\". Turning the overlay off seems to fix this problem. If you want to actually fix the overlay, try using dgVoodoo2. (described here in another discussion) This is from the link mentioned above: To prevent crashes, and fix other things, try using dgVoodoo2. As described here https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/app\/225300\/discussio... there is a \"DirectX wrapper\" called dgVoodoo2 that helps with several of the old TR games (from TR-II to TR-V), and fixes issues with the Steam overlay, window borders, aspect ratio and various crashes.Download it here: http:\/\/dege.freeweb.hu\/You just need to copy the .dll files from the \"MS\" folder into the game folder of any game you want to fix, plus the dgVoodooCpl.exe file somewhere else. Running the control panel allows you to hide the \"dgVoodoo Watermark\" and adjust some display options.Then \"launch setup\" when you run the game. Use the launch option: -setup For TR2\/3\/4 you may also want to try the widescreen patch: https:\/\/tombraiders.net\/stella\/downloads\/widesc...Taken from Steam\u2019s discussion pages for the TR games."]},{"symptom":"Issues while accessing Settings and Xbox app on PC        Hello,I can't access my emails & accounts in settings.

Instead, I get BSOD during boot with errors \"KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED\" or \"PAGE_FAULT_IN_NON_PAGED_AREA\". I then have to run startup repair and reinstall the update; it usually works the second time, but sometimes requires more than two attempts.Windows seems to occasionally attempt to install an update that is already installed, again prompting BSOD.
