Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I'll give you everything possible to repair the store. Even if you've tried a step please do it over in this sequence. If any steps cannot be performed then report it and move on to the next:1) Try updating Store apps: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/402625... 2) Make sure you have the latest Windows 10 version 1909 in Settings > System > About and if not skip to Step 10 to install it by the most stable method.3) See if the fixes here help: https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3053099\/windows... 4) Try running the Windows Store apps Troubleshooter at Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.5) Try resetting the Store cache: http:\/\/www.thewindowsclub.com\/reset-windows-sto... 6) If that fails go to Settings>Apps and highlight Microsoft Store, choose Advanced Settings, then Reset. After it resets, restart PC.7) If that fails then reinstall Store. Type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Administrator, copy the following code and paste it into the box using the Edit tools from Box's top left dropdown menu, press Enter:PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command \"& {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage *WindowsStore*).InstallLocation + '\\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}\"8) Clear the LocalCache Folder: Open Run by pressing the Windows key + R hotkey.

Press the Ctrl + A hotkey to select all content within the LocalCache folder. Press the Delete button. 9) If these all fail then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account because of the serious and persistent problem with corrupted accounts. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.10) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool and then choosing to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

I turned off snap and now a maximized window on my desktop won't drag and get smaller.I browsed this site and did the Restorehealth in the command prompt thing, also sys scannow with no help.In regedit, my hkey current user control panel desktop Drag from Maximum is set to \"1\".How do I keep snap off and be able to drag maximized windows?ThanksMoved from: Windows \/ Windows 10 \/ Ease of access","solutions":["Don't maximize it and then you can drag its edges to make it full size if you want that - and then you can move it by grabbing the title bar.Click the little square icon to the left of the top right x on the title bar.","That's not a fix. Comon, I could drag a maximized window for the 2 years I've had the laptop, until a few days ago. Something changed and I want to set it back.","I could drag a maximized window\u00a0Mike is right.\u00a0 If the window is maximized the window's window menu will prevent you from moving or resizing it and that has always been the case. \u00a0 Use Alt-Space to see this.\u00a0 Restore, Minimize and Close are your only options in this state.\u00a0 So almost certainly you would have been dragging a maximally sized window.\u00a0 In that case everything except Restore would have been available--a sign that the window is in its normal mode.FYIRobert Aldwinckle---","Richard.You certainly respond with some implied authority. So in your vast and insightful vision of all beings using a computer, I've not clicked the little square icon at the top any window but have always been dragging the corners to make it appear maximized.Well shucks, I've forgotten this little exercise, which I must have done countless times. Wow!! Scratching my head. EXCUSE ME!But really, there's some disconnect here. Like I said, I maximize some windows, but did not have to click the double-box icon to reduce the size. All I had to do was drag from the title bar and the window reduced to the previous non-maximized size.Comon, if you don't want to explain or don't know, just say so.The Meat","I maximize some windows, but did not have to click the double-box icon to reduce the size. All I had to do was drag from the title bar and the window reduced to the previous non-maximized size.You can do that using the Snap windows feature but check out the window menu when you do that.\u00a0 E.g. press Win+CursorUp ;\u00a0 that snaps the window to Maximized. \u00a0 Press Alt-Space to see that only the menu items I mentioned before for a maximized window are available. \u00a0 When you are using the Snap windows feature with your pointer you need to drag it up first and observe the ghost maximized frame before clicking to make it snap to Maximized mode.\u00a0 An analogous procedure is needed when you want to snap a window left or right.\u00a0 Then I think the use of the pointer for a half screen may be clearer when snapping a window into a new mode and undoing the snap.So, to clarify the original discussion, you weren't really dragging a maximized window you were moving your pointer in a way that looked as if you were but in fact were only doing that to change the window's mode and size.FYIRobert---","Listen, Robert, I didn't do any of that, I simply grabbed the title bar of the window I had maximized and dragged it down left, down right whatever.
