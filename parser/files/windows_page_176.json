Still occurring in 1903 upgrade        Below is a description of the problem++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++Unfortunately, I have not had a response from someone who can escalate this issue with Microsoft. Long story short, I have had the above laptop since August 2018 which was preinstalled with 1803. The system comes with a i5 8250u, 8GB ram, 250GB M2 SSD and a MX150 Nvidia. The laptop works perfectly on Windows 10 1803 with no BSODs or any error messages. On upgrading to 1809 the system will crash either when installing the nvidia driver or once a game or 3d application has finished using the nvidia GPU. For example, I can run a game for one hour with good temperatures and no graphics abnormalities; everything seems normal. However once the game or photoshop has been closed and I am back on the desktop using the intel GPU, a BSOD VIDEO_DXGKNL_FATAL_ERROR is always shown. This does not happen with 1803, and this does not happen when using a Linux OS.All different drivers from acer, intel, nvidia have been tried, uninstalled and re-tried. It does not matter which driver I install as they do not fix the problem. This issue that I am experiencing has been discussed on this MS community website, and on the acer forums. The only resolution thus far is to rollback to 1803 where the system is 100% stable. Tonight I decided to read about the new 1903 update that is soon to be released. I am currently signed up to the Windows Insider Program and have updated to the latest preview build. Tonight I have found that the same issue when installing the GPU, or once a application\/game has finished using the GPU my system will GSOD \/ BSOD just like 1809. This issue has been ongoing since 1809 with lots of users posting about this problem when using a google search. I am now currently at a complete loss as the issue does not seem to have been fixed, or had the attention from someone who could possibly put measures in place to fix this. I have disabled the Nvidia GPU in device manager so that I am able to type this post without having tons of BSODs when only a web browser is open. Since I have moved to 1809 and 1903; tonight I have had over 20 BSODs with five of them happening after entering the login pin at the password screen. Once the nvidia gpu is disabled and I am only using the Intel GPU, the system is 100% stable but without the high performance from the nvidia GPU. I really appreciate anyone who can assist me with this further.+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++The above problem has been reported on a number of Forums, but basically the same problem.The only known fixes that have worked appear to be to go back to Windows 10 1803, the disable any further Windows updating. Or to disable the Nvidia MX150 device. None of these fixes are a permanent solution for myself.\u00a0This problem started with Windows 10 1809 release, and is still a problem with Windows 10 release1903.Do Microsoft know about this problem? Is it being addressed? Have Microsoft put out any information regarding this problem?

When you are logged in to Windows, press the Start button, and type in: lusrmgs.msc and press Enter. This will bring up a window for Local Users and Groups. On the left side, click on the Users folder, then locate your user account on the right side.Then, right click your username, and click \"Properties\". There should be a checkbox here for \"Password never expires\". You can select this and then press OK to save.---- Another area to check is within the Local Group Policy Editor to ensure the PIN expiration is disabled.Press the Start button, and type in: gpedit.msc and press Enter. This will bring up the Local Group Policy Editor. In the folder structure to the left, go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > System > PIN ComplexityOn the right side, there is a Setting called Expiration, and you can set the value to 0 to have the PIN never expire.A website with screenshots to follow: https:\/\/www.top-password.com\/blog\/tag\/your-orga...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

Is there anything else I can try?","Hi Matthew, It sounds like you might have Windows 10 Home installed then. One way to do this is to open the Command Prompt as Administrator:Start > type in \"cmd\" , and you should see Command Prompt, Desktop app come up. Right click on this, and select \"Run as administrator\"This will open up a black window called Administrator: Command Prompt To disable password expiration for your account, type in the command: wmic UserAccount where Name='YOURUSERNAME' set PasswordExpires=False then press Enter. If it is successful, it will display \"Updating property(s) of ...\" followed by \"Property(s) update successful.\"Hopefully this works, and will resolve the prompts you are receiving about the password and PIN expiring.-Ashton","Okay this did work, thank you very much.\u00a0","Hi Matthew, thanks for getting back to us!
