The issue is, I have exhausted every fix I have come across, so I decided to look deeper into my computer files to find the source of the problem.I came across this [npsvctrig - Named pipe service trigger provider] with the status \"severe\" and I found out that this service aims to trigger certain programs and responses, and when it is unable to do so it reboots, causing either a crash, cpu reboot, and in some cases, a graphics card reboot, which will effect the display being used.The issue I am having now is finding a trustworthy source to download from in order to restore the npsvctrig service. The one I found is:\u00a0http:\/\/batcmd.com\/windows\/10\/services\/npsvctrig\/. I'm not sure if this website is trustworthy, and I do not wish to find out.If anyone could tell me if they have used this site before without issue, or if somebody has another link I could use, it would be greatly appreciated.Thanks!Andrew","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Setting different times for \"sleep mode\" and \"lockout\" in Windows 10        Is there a way to set different times for \"sleep mode\" and \"lockout\"?\u00a0 Just updated to Windows 10 (from Windows 7).\u00a0\u00a0 In Windows 7, when the computer went to \"sleep\" I did not have to reenter my password to get back on the computer.\u00a0 But, that's what I am having to do with Windows 10.\u00a0 I went into settings...it would allow me to change the settings, but it would not allow me to put in different settings.\u00a0 Thanks.","solutions":["Hi Donald.

The only option is to turn the verification on, which somehow already happened and I have no idea how or why. I could have inadvertently thought I was clicking on something else when this happened a couple of months ago, not sure.I am sick of getting a screen that requires me to enter the last 4 of my home phone number, then get an automated call with a code that I have to enter just to delete my search or browsing history! That should not happen to anyone that only wants to delete the unnecessary ****. Clearing by disk cleanup does not clear half of the stuff - you have to sign in to Microsoft, then get surprised by a bunch of hidden ad links from all your pages you visited, click on delete the search or browsing to get rid of it. This never happened in earlier Windows versions. I hate Edge, and am not sure if it is just Edge, or what.Does anyone know how to turn off two step verification when the option to turn it off does not even show on the screen when I follow all of the instructions to turn it off? I even clicked on the 'turn on two-step verification' link, hoping there would be an option, but that was just to continue with getting it, which I already mysteriously have.
