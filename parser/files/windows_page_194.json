Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough.

Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) Compare the install you did with this gold standard Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link has ever come back to report problems that I have seen.
