{"windows":[{"symptom":"windows10 stopcode error: WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR        Hello,\u00a0\u00a0 I have been recently receiving the WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR on my custom built computer just about anytime I turned the system on and quite frankly, this is getting a bit annoying. Everyday it gets a blue-screen at least 2 or 3 times per day or evening that I use my system. I have had to rebuild my system several times over the course of several months when I was running version: 1709, and that's when the problems started.\u00a0 My system would crash every time I opened Microsoft Edge or I.E.11. Thinking that an important update would solve the problem I updated my system to version:1803 and the problems appeared to be getting worst and not better.\u00a0 \u00a0 The end result was that my system crashed from an unrecoverable error and I lost everything. Not even the system restore points worked or could be found. It was like the system restore points didn't work at all.\u00a0 System would not boot to the hard-drive nor could it be recovered from a emergency Windows 10 repair disk. The end results was having to reinstall Windows 7 Ultimate until Microsoft find a solution to this nightmare.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 October 2019 I decided to upgrade again to Windows 10 but this time back to 1809 with the assumption that a fix was found that would resolve the earlier problems Microsoft had with version: 1903. A few days went by and ensured that all of the required and recommended updates were installed properly my system seemed to be running stable with no issues. However, a week later it \"File Explorer\" started freezing up or not responding so I did a hard restart to get the system back online and it worked for about an hour. File Explore froze again and then a \"Blue Screen\" occurred with the error code: WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 Ever since the last week of October I've only experienced nothing but the bluescreen error. All of my device drivers are up-to-date and so is my Antivirus software. I've ran memory scans as well as \"SFC SCANNOW\" and CHKDSK on my system for problems and nothing is found to be a problem. Can someone tell me what is going on with this annoying WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR that I'm experiencing with my system?\u00a0 I am not sure how to resolve this, when I look in event logger it shows as WHEA-logger event 19, not sure if that helps in deciphering the issue or not but I will provide further information if required.

There is NO problem with the touch screen though.Furthermore, I want to make very clear what the specific problem is. My left click DOES work. The thing is it does NOT work in one very specific situation. I can provide two examples of what I'm talking about.1) On Youtube: If I press the space bar to start a video (assuming it was paused to begin with) and then try to left click the screen to pause the video, the click does not register. In fact, I can click up to 5 times before it actually registers that I'm left clicking and then, eventually, registers that I left clicked and pauses the video. But that's only if i click again later. If i don't click again, it just completely ignores the fact that I clicked to begin with (it's not just a delay, it's literally acting like i didn't do anything). This does NOT happen with the right click.2) On FL Studio (music DAW): Same exact thing as with youtube. If i press play and the song starts, I can't add musical notes inside the piano roll using the left click button. It acts as if i didn't click, but then if I wait like a second or two, then it will recognize that I am left clicking. Ruins my workflow.\u00a0It seems to have something to do with the \"processing power\" (or something, I'm not an expert) because if i'm not telling either YouTube or FL Studio to play the media first, then there's no problem. The problem only happens immediately after i press engage the video to start (YouTube) or the song to start (FL Studio).\u00a0I'm NOT the only person with this problem.https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/all\/have-to-click-twice-on-everything-for-windows-81\/70e2413b-e720-454e-b0a7-dd0644182921Like i said, this started happening after i did a clean boot from usb. I did another clean boot after to try to fix the problem, but it didn't fix anything.I obviously tried reinstalling the drivers, but like i said, it's not just the mouse. its the left button on the pad on the laptop and also the single touch on the pad (single touch that registers as a left click).\u00a0","solutions":["I suggest you start the trouble-shooting effort with simple left-click actions, e.g. like so:Single click any desktop item.

After the reinstall, Windows 10 will detect that it has been reinstalled on a previously activated system and will automatically reactivate. DetailsPrinted on a Certificate of Authenticity StickerIf your PC came with Windows 7 or earlier, then your product key will be printed on a COA sticker. This sticker verifies that the computer came with a genuine copy of Windows. You will need to examine your computer to find the sticker. On laptops, it's usually on the bottom side. On desktops, it could be on the back, sides, or top. It looks something like this:Embedded in the PC's UEFI firmwareIf you have a newer PC that came with Windows 8 or Windows 10, then your product key likely won't be on a sticker. Instead, computer manufacturers now embed the key right into the computer's UEFI firmware. Unlike the COA sticker, the embedded key can't be smudged off, stolen or erased (easily).If you want to extract the UEFI key, the process is simple. Open the Start menu, typepowershell and then run the program.Next type the following command in the PowerShell window and hit Enter.(Get-WmiObject -query 'select * from SoftwareLicensingService').OA3xOriginalProductKeyYou will be presented with the key in the window.Stored in the Windows RegistryIf your product key isn't embedded in the firmware or you're missing your COA sticker, you're not out of luck as long as you haven't formatted your computer.
