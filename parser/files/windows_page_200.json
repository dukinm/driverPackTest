The attached figure shows time on the x-axis and total usage (in hours) on the y-axis. The total usagewas calculated as follows: total usage = active battery duration + connected standby battery duration + active AC duration + connected standby AC duration (please see column headers in the second figure \"Usage History\" table to make sense of what I am trying to explain).My question is this: given my recent experience of quick battery drains while the laptop is in connected standby, should I be concerned with the spikes seen in the figure? In theory at least, shouldn't we expect the blue curve to be very close to the\u00a0orange line of 168 hours?\u00a0Thanks,John","solutions":["Hi John, These oddities you are in the battery report coincide with a battery life that is less the optimal.
