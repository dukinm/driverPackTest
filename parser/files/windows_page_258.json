If still the issue persists, then we can report this as a bug.Refer to the following Microsoft Help article to configure multiple monitors. The steps for Windows 8\/Windows 8.1 applies to Windows 10 as well.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-US\/windows-8\/how-connect-multiple-monitorsPlease feel free to visit our website for any help with Windows Operating System.","I also have this problem. When I grab the title bar and move the app toward the second display, the cursor gets stuck at the edge of the first display.","Only thing I've found is to go into settings, system, multitasking and disable snap... However this disables it completely. A real fix would also be nice...","Yeah, I really hope MS fixes this. I have found that if you move the window super fast, it will break through this invisible wall and move to the next monitor. But that threshold is WAY too fast. The default needs to be way lower and give people the ability to change the speed threshold if they want.But how did this get passed by QA before release?! This is painful!And yes, I don't want to disable Snap to \"Fix\" this. As I love to snap apps for a quick split work view. This worked great with multiple monitors in Windows 8 and now it's terrible.UPDATE: This has been fixed for me for months now.","You thing if someone have dual monitors need advice how to setup the system??WINDOWS 10 HAVE THE SAME ISSUE LIKE WINDOWS 8\/8.1 ON DUAL MONITORS. ON WINDOWS 8\/8.1 WAS A REGISTRY FIX.So as a forum moderator ask microsoft to fix this stupid issue and then come back to give as advices how to connect dual monitors on our system.","Is not from the SNAP....HereI use the window snapping feature a lot, but mainly for maximizing windows. I have adual screen setup and when I drag a window along the top edge of the screen onto the second screen, it becomes stuck. This is very annoying, because I often want to move a window from screen 1 to screen 2 and maximize it at the same time.I first thought that this issue was related to the new ability to snap windows to one of the four corners. But even if I turn off snapping entirely and even if I am not dragging a window at all, mymouse becomes stuck in the top right corner of the first screen.http:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/customization\/13364-prevent-mouse-getting-stuck-corners-dual-screen-setup.html","Yes, this is exactly what I am seeing too. \u00a0You can break the barrier by speeding the mouse cursor across the boundary between monitors, but it's ridiculous interface behaviour and surely not right.","Is not even the speed of the mouse.... Is 28x28 pixels dead zone for the mouse on the top and bottom middle area of the desktops. I have this issue also with 3 monitors. I give them another week...if is not fix I move back to 7","The symptom you are talking about, is indeed not part of the Snap feature. But it is also not the issue this thread is about. And it is not part of Windows 10. You are referring to the Charms Bar. Which is activated by the top-right corner as well as the whole right each of each screen. The Charms Bar has been removed completely from Windows 10.The issue here is specific to Windows 10 only. While Windows 8 first introduced the Snap feature, Windows 8 and 8.1 have a different threshold of sensitivity to the screen borders. In Windows 8.x, you can easily move windows between multiple monitors without getting stuck between screens. You actually have to make an effort to go slow enough and pause at the border between screens to activate the Snap feature. But in Windows 10, this threshold is way too sensitive\/low\/high\/fast. As it activates way too easily. Microsoft should have left the threshold setting the same as Windows 8.x or offered a slider bar for the user to adjust the sensitivity.At this point, I would be happy with even a registry edit to give it the same Snap threshold as Windows 8.x, but I have not found that yet. I am also still hoping that Microsoft releases a Windows update to put the setting back to the way it was in Windows 8.Again this issue, of this thread, is specific to Windows 10 only right now.","Hi there.You try to tell me that your mouse can move between the monitors ( Top or Bottom ) without stop?? ( I'm talking about windows 10 ) I mean with or with out window move.If your answer is YES....then we are talking about different issue.I have contact Microsoft support last week and they login in to my computer ( I point them also this thread ) I show them the issue and they confirm that they are investigating the problem at the moment and they let an update fix in the future.I have try also with 3 monitors and I have this issue\/problem also.

OEM versions are not transferrable, while a Retail version is. When the motherboard is changed, it is generally considered a new computer and so I believe the original license may have been OEM in your case.The Windows activation is generally linked to the Microsoft Account you use to log in, so activation would hopefully occur seamlessly if you are using the same account to log in.If you are not using a Microsoft account and if you haven't done this already, you can try to run the Activation Troubleshooter located from the Start Menu > Settings > Update and security > Activation and run the troubleshooter.Otherwise, you may need to contact Microsoft Support directly via phone or live chat:https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/...This article has an overview of the activation process which may be helpful: https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/transfer-windo...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

Sorry to hear that you were on hold with the support line for so long.For info, we do not have any ability to look up or modify license information so we can only provide a referral to Microsoft for license activation lookup\/modifications.I looked up that license, and it appears to be linked to Cyberpower PC (https:\/\/www.cyberpowerpc.com\/)Is this where you got your computer? If so, it looks like they have Windows pre-installed and shipped on the computer, which means it was very likely an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) license.

I would have thought this would be a simple and obvious function for Windows, but it seems that Win10 has made this simple obvious function ridiculously difficult -- or perhaps impossible -- if the existing network consists of Win7 computers.I have an existing network of three Win7 computers -- which all work perfectly (other than the incessant dire warnings from Microsoft that they are all about to turn into pumpkins at the stroke of midnight).I now have two Win10 computers that need to join the network.\u00a0 These two computers both see the network.\u00a0 These two computers both see the existing computers on the network.\u00a0 The other computers on the network can see that these computers exist on the network.Using a Win 10 computer I can copy files from shared folders on any of the Win7 computers (however large transfers seem to die because Win10 keeps stopping transferring the files if it takes too long) -- also it is a major pain to find and drag each file from the Win7 computer simply because the Win10 laptop is a pain in the butt with its weird interface).It would be much more convenient if I could use the Win7 computer to simply tag and drag the files to the Win10 computer, but the process seems to be entirely one way.\u00a0 Any time I try to access the Win10 laptop from one of the Win7 computers, it wants an ID and password -- but of course there is no such User ID and password.I have only been using computers every day of my life since CP\/M on an 8-bit system that I built from scratch, so obviously I have not yet learned how to use a computer or a network yet.\u00a0 I've used CP\/M, DOS, Windows 3, 3.1, 3.11, 95, 98, 2000, XP, 7 and probably a version or two that I have forgotten, but I have to admit that Windows 10 is just plain weird to me.\u00a0 I am used to Microsoft moving stuff around and changing the names of functions and settings, but I cannot find anything in this nightmare.Short of installing Windows 7 on both the new laptops, is there any way to get these computers to actually work?\u00a0 The two largest frustrations are that open windows want to magically disappear (sometimes to be found hiding on the task bar, sometimes not) and the problems with Win10's aforementioned refusal to play nicely with others allowing other computers to pass files to the Win10 computers.I'm sure that I must be missing something because I cannot believe that anything that works as badly as Win10 seems to could have survived but I cannot find any meaningful instructions for using Win10 beyond the idea that the user is irrelevant and should just let Windows run the show.","solutions":["Hi N4.

They offer 15gb free storage for this. Download here:https:\/\/www.google.com\/drive\/You can of course do the same with OneDrive (possibly what they intended by removing HomeGroup and breaking File Sharing) but with only 5gb free.
