I see in your screenshot the Windows taskbar is not affected. Have you tried updating the drivers for your hardware via the manufacturer? Go to your PCs manufacturer website and be sure video display drivers are most recent. If this continues after this please let us know. Take Care, Andrew","Yes I have already updated, rolled back to drivers were I didn't have but it didn't change. It usually only happens in apps like the PTB of discord or today when I installed Visual Studio Code for the first time. The glitching is also only visibal when I'm using the app or in the case of Discord when I'm connected to a channel and I have it running on my second screen.","One thing I forgot to mention is that I am using a Windows Insider Program OS build.
