After i back up i will start to work thru ur directions.\u00a0So again thank you so much & if u dont mind answering my tech support BACK& UP QUESTIONS id appreciate it.","Courtney, these are necessary steps to operate a smaller hard drive, so unless you want to have a shop install a larger drive - preferable an SSD which is lightning fast - faster than a new higher end PC without one - I'd work through them yourself so you learn the methods to manage this. If you get stuck you only need to ask back as I will be here to help until this case is resolved.If you want to try Microsoft Support you can contact them on Monday by one of these phone numbers:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/405170...You can also go here: https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/... choose the link for Browser help, interact briefly about your exact problem, keep replying \"agent\" until it connects with an agent.","Okay so i attempted to remove some data off C drive by moving my files into OneDrive cloud but after i opened onedrive, which opened office 2 show how 2 move my files & start using OneDrive, i started syncing my files\/folders & suddenly i got a pop up stating it couldn't complete because i was completely out of data. So that took more data. I went ahead & uninstalled onedrive & now im back to 26.6GB of But29.1 i need like 8gb I think it said to update windows. Which on the sd chip ive only used 572mb of 7.28gb so i dont understand why it can't use space from both. Im just going to call tech support. Obviously if i tried one of the steps and just made ot worse i should leave it to the experts. Thank uou so much for your help though","Isn't it referring to available storage space in Onedrive. You can buy more for cheap if needed or move files to your SD card to fit the rest in Onedrive space available.","I already went to storage & clicked on my C drive to list what each app is taking what amount of space. On that page it has the option to click on each specific app which has 2 options move or uninstall but almost all of them has the move button disabled the only thing i could \"click move\" for was a game that gave me option to move ito sd so i did. Then i changed all my apps to store in sd other than C drive. Im unaware what apps i am able to uninstall without messing up my computer. What else am i able to move to app other than a game app. I dont have any pics or docs,or anything personal on C all pics on sd. Am i able to move Program files folder or windows folder from C drive to my sd somehow? And as far as OneDrive when i chose to upload move files it wouldn't let me hot okay until it popped up \"this will take storage space on C drive\" im judt going to try the sd card again. Sorry for all the trouble.","I will answer more in-depth when I get home in about an hour. What error do you get when you try to enable folder protection and files on demand for OneDrive?","My windows version is 1607 you have to have a more recent version to\u00a0 get files on demand. I think like 162something. I checked though my version isn't updated enough","Courtney 1607 is way too old. Go back to my first post and do the upgrade to 1909 manually from Media so it will install.
