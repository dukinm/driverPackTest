I apologize for the length of this post, but I figured the more detailed I can be, the better answers and suggestions any of you might have.I recently built a gaming PC in July 2019. The PC worked fine until we had a power outage that caused the PC to turn off abruptly. Thankfully the PC was plugged into a surge protector. \u00a0However, since then, my PC has been consistently crashing with a myriad of BSOD and accompanying stop codes. The crashes occur sporadically - either every 15-20 minutes or with hours\/days between them. \u00a0They also tend to happen no matter what the PC is doing - gaming, idling, watching Netflix\/Hulu - it doesn't seem to matter.The most common ones that I see are:Critical Process DiedUnknown Store ExceptionSystem Service ExceptionMemory Management (Although I've only seen this error once)Here is a list of everything that I've attempted to troubleshoot the issue. I must apologize, as I am an extreme novice when it comes to this, but I just want to get this PC working again.1. Updated all drivers and windows2. Completed several full scans of anti-virus software (Windows Defender)3. Run system file checker. All scans have come back clean4. Run the DISM Tool. Found no issues here either5. Run chkdsk. This came back clean, although it took almost 24 full hours to complete. I'm not sure if that's normal6. Run memtest86. In total, I've run 40 passes through both partitions, and suffered 0 errors or failsAfter reading through many threads of people having similar issues; looking for something that might work for myself, I see that I should also update my BiOS. I have not done that yet - as I'm scared to. Some sites mention that updating your BiOS is likely never necessary;and in fact on the site for my motherboard's BiOS - it suggests not to update it if things are running normally. If you all think I should go ahead and do this, I will - I just don't want to brick my PC. And I'm not sure that its BiOS related, since the issues have been ongoing since about a month after I built my PC.The one thing that has worked in the past is running memtest86. After my first 8 passes (on each partition), the crashes stopped for about 3 months. I traveled home for the holidays with my PC and they promptly started again. Each subsequent run has seemed to put a stop to the crashes for days, at most.After the crashes first began, I took the PC to a MicroCenter repair shop. They charged me $40, but told me they didn't come across any issues while the PC was there. The crashes did stop for a few weeks once I got the PC back home,however.One last thing that I think is worth mentioning: When I get the BSOD and accompanying stop code, my PC does attempt to reboot. However, upon attempting the reboot - it tells me to insert a boot drive. By turning off the PC and turning it back on, the OS boots back up normally.Thank you for taking the time to read through this. I genuinely appreciate any and all suggestions to help resolve this.","solutions":["How big is the Disk drive?","How big is the Disk drive?Sorry, I should've included that.

After endless problems with it I changed to TeamViewer and AnyDesk ten years ago and would never go back. These are free with consumer use; AnyDesk is less likely to mistake connecting from a school or business as business (paid) usage than TeamViewer. Either one are totally reliable compared to RDP.See comparison here: https:\/\/www.gb-advisors.com\/teamviewer-vs-anyde...There's a workaround to use RDP in Home version here that might still work: https:\/\/www.thewindowsclub.com\/how-to-use-windo...I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.
