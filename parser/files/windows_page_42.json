That's usually the second step, the one for activating the Acceleration which is known for trouble. Check that, taken from my personal site about the Microsoft FS franchise:The registration of the FSX firstly installed does not pose troubles, generally as the one of the Acceleration Pack does. Once installed and launching back FSX you may get a 1-80004005 error, which will limit the use of your FSX at 30 minute of time. The solution, which is widely given on the Internet, resides into a faulty entry of the Windows Registry. To fix that, run 'regedit' from Cortana and launch that utility. It will show you the registry content. CAUTION, THAT CONTAINS SENSITIVE DATA! DO NOT CHANGE ANYTHING EXCEPT WHAT FOLLOWS! Expand HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CURRENTCONTROLSET\\CONTROL\\CLASS\\{4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}. In the left column, double-click the UpperFilters entry (note! there may be there several {4D36E967-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318} entries; just find the one which holds UpperFilters). Thence three possibilities: either you will just read 'partmgr,' and just change that into 'PartMgr' -- with capitals -- and exit the registry by clicking to the upper right as registry automatically saves. Either you will find a '0' value; change it too to 'PartMgr' and idem. Or, at last, you may find other values of which 'partmgr'; some advice to first backup tall those, then erase everything except 'partmgr' (you will turn to 'PartMgr'; exit idem, and once the registration performed, you may paste the backup back). In all cases, once the Registry entry fixed, restart your PC and then launch FSX. The registration panel will pop up!"]},{"symptom":"[Windows build 1709] PC crashing at 71% update to build 1909        Hello, I have a problem.

I just want to confirm.If I take the first option-\u00a0What I'd do first is sort you files into their User folders (Documents, Pictures, Desktop, Downloads, etc) then move them to the new drive. See how here:http:\/\/www.dummies.com\/computers\/operating-syst...Then that would free up some space on SSD one and put some stuff on SSD two, correct?If that is correct then I DON'T have to install the operating system\/drivers\/etc., onto SSD two?","Why would you install Windows on the second SSD? Only if it's faster and you want to replace the one on the first SSD. Otherwise you'd have two Windows 10 installs requiring two licenses, for what reason?Yes, moving Files and then as necessary Apps off of C should make plenty of space.","Why? I don't know.....I am new to all of this and obviously wrongly assumed that I NEEDED to have my operating system on both drives in order for my programs to work properly. I'm having difficulty wrapping my head around how to use the second SSD and how it gets filled. On one hand I've been told that as the first SSD reaches its' capacity all writing will simply default to the second SSD on its' own. I'm not so sure that is true and rather than wait until the C drive is completely full I wanted to begin investigating for the correct way to do things.With all my installed programs on my C drive I couldn't fathom how any program could run if I was suddenly operating from my new drive that did not have an operating system or boot details or programs installed upon it. As I said - new to this.So, as a for instance, let's say I move photos to my new drive. I see that I can access them from file explorer. However, let's use my Office365 as an example. Office (the program) is installed on the C drive. All the items sit in the 'my documents' folder on the C drive. When I want to access any documents I click on the icon for Word or Excel on my taskbar and then select the file I want to work with. If I move the\u00a0my documents folder over to the D (new) drive then am I correct to understand that I would now only be able to access them from file explorer? Clicking on the icon on the taskbar would no longer work? Correct? IF that is correct, THAT is why I assumed I had to have Windows and my programs on the second drive if I wanted to continue to access them from my taskbar . Hope that makes sense? Thanks for any further help.","No, it will not spill over into the second SSD automatically. That's why I carefully wrote out all of the ways to use the second SSD optimally so that you balance the space used on both drives.You would not install Windows to the second drive or you'd have another Windows to manage which you dont' need. Just use the second drive to offload files first as per the instructions I wrote out in first post, then when needed install new Apps to the second SSD via Storage settings. But having the User folders on the second SSD should cover it since everything you put in Documents, Downloads, Pictures, etc is going to go to the new SSD without any effort. Just keep your files in their User folders.I would not move Desktop folder off of the first SSD as it can cause problems. But all other User folders at C:\\Users\\Your User Name can be moved there per the tutorial I gave.Let me know how this goes and if you have any other questions."]},{"symptom":"Need to do a reset to change microsoft admin account name        I recently purchased a new Dell laptop and had my employee prepare it for me.\u00a0 She made the mistake of using my microsoft account instead of creating a local account when first starting the computer.

Have you looked at Settings>Accounts? Be sure to read all information provided.","Thank you for your reply. I actually did something like that but when I logged into the new account the system started changing all sorts of settings I had made for my original account because I had installed a lot of things already.\u00a0 For example, I installed Classic Shell and Dropbox (with lots of local files) and Adobe Acrobat and I made the latter my default for opening PDFs. As soon as I first logged into the new local account, I got a variety of messages changing my defaults back to MS Edge (which I do not use). So, I got worried that perhaps I would wreck my access to everything I set up on the original account (because I know very little about accounts) and logged out and logged into the original account and deleted the second account I created.\u00a0I actually uninstalled most of the stuff I installed preparing for a factory reset so it probably makes no difference now (I guess I should have come here with this question first).\u00a0 But I'm curious, if I had continued with the second account I described above and deleted the original admin account, would my view\/access have been the exact same as the original account except for these irritating default changes that the system did automatically?","My employee's grandfather just passed so I'm not bother her.
