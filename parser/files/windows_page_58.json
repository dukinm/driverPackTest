Windows is making it tricky for you to move the file or folder so you can't accidentally cause a problem. If you want to move a program to another drive you should uninstall and reinstall that program - and during the install process choose the required drive.If you really do want to attempt to move this file or folder you can right-click it, go to Properties, then Security and give yourself the required permissions - but, I would not recommend this.Regards, David"]},{"symptom":"I am installing windows 10 on a lenovo laptop with windows 7 installed.
