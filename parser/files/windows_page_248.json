Is there any way I can retrieve the documents from that computer, particularly in Word. They are not in the cloud or onedrive. I got the MS office as a student, if that helps","solutions":["Hi Byron. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.When you install Office it offers to place the files in Onedrive so they are always within reach via the internet in cases like these. But you said you didn't do that, correct? So what kind of backup do you have? If it's a System Image backup you can mount it to extract the files that were present when you made that image. But you really need a file backup, and another cloud backup like the one you were offered when you set up Office. In fact Office 365 includes 1tb of free OneDrive storage in addition to the 5gb which already comes free.","Sorry ... bad news: Unless you have a backup somewhere else, your personal files are wherever you were storing them. Microsoft doesn't make a second copy.More bad news ... As much as it burns to be robbed, you may have a bigger problem: the theft of your personal identity.By now, your computer is in the trash. The only part of it that's of any interest to a thief is your hard drive, and not even the hard drive itself but the information you had stored there. Please do this ASAP:Change all your online passwords. Change every one, but particularly for email and financial institutions.Be on the lookout for signs that your identity may be stolen. Work with your insurance company and the local police. Being robbed sucks big time - don't let it suck more than it already has. Best wishes to you.","Your question is like saying \"My briefcase was stolen. Is there any way I can get back the papers I had in it?\"No, of course not--not unless the thief is caught and what he stole returned to you.Or unless you have them backed up somewhere, but your question makes it sound like you don't. So for the future, let me give you my standard advice on backing up:Almost everyone should be backing up to external media regularly. It is always possible that a hard drive crash, user error, nearby lightning strike, virus attack, even theft of the computer, can cause the loss of everything on your drive.

You should also download and install any critical or important Windows Updates.If the issue persists, try connecting the controller through a different USB port, preferably, powered ports found on the back of the PC.Regards.","Patricia,As James Couhig said, it works through usb port.

After hours of searching on how to get my controller working without spending another $25 on an xbox adapter, you have provided the solution. Thank you! I can now connect my xbox one s controller via bluetooth to my PC. If its still not working for anybody, remember to update everything, and then restart your PC. Then do the instruction in this post, and viola. Flawless. This should really be a much simpler process though, what the heck, Microsoft? I think they just want you to spend money on their stupid adapter. Commenting to give this thread a bump in the hopes it shows up further up on the google search","Kai, you rock!
