I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all. Even if you've tried a step, please do it over in sequence:Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see. If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:1) Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter from Windows Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.2) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/10164\/.... Try running that first. 3) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service: Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key.net stop wuauserv net stop cryptSvc net stop bits net stop msiserver Ren C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old Ren C:\\Windows\\System32\\catroot2 Catroot2.old net start wuauserv net start cryptSvc net start bits net start msiserver Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then 4) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install, which are logged at Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update > Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:http:\/\/test.catalog.update.microsoft.com\/v7\/sit... 5) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/224471\/how-to-prevent... 6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 7) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open installed Tool and choose to Upgrade the PC Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version 1909. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... _____________________ Good news! There are major changes in Version 1903 giving back control over Updates to the consumer.

If you are installing Windows 8.1 because you mistakenly think it must be reinstalled to upgrade to Windows 10 then this is not necessary. You can directly install Windows 10 and it will reactivate with the Digital License issued when you first Upgraded. If not and you only want Windows 8.1 then these same steps for troubleshooting install still apply:I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases. If not we'll go from there:Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Special steps for reinstalling Windows 8.1 are here: https:\/\/www.eightforums.com\/tutorials\/2299-clea...Pay close attention to Step 4 for how to reactivate as it's different than most. Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged. Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM or Legacy BIOS disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install: https:\/\/www.mydigitallife.net\/comprehensive-lis... https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/reset-pc-bios-...Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m....

Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial. It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC. If all else fails you can move the hard drive to another PC to do the install with it plugged in alone. Windows 10 is remarkably adaptive to new hardware without needing adaptive restore. If it will start it will swap out all drivers requiring several restarts. You can also try applying a same-version System Image to the intact SSD\/hard drive.I hope this helps.
