You don't have to do those if you want to sit with a PC that doesn't work after the repairs fail.The steps explain how to rescue your files. The fact you dont' have your files backed up is reckless and values them at nothing. Your files should always be backed up because a hard drive can die at any time without notice. Some suggestions to help ease into this habit: 1) You can sync your Desktop, Documents and Pictures folder using OneDrive Backup, or just drag valuable files into OneDrive folder, offering 5gb free with additional space for cheap:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/116029-turn... 2) Google Drive has a new Backup that allows you to choose User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15gb for free to their cloud in real time so it always has the latest version.https:\/\/www.google.com\/intl\/en-GB_ALL\/drive\/dow... 3) In addition I'd have an on-site hard copy backup. The best way to do this is to sort all of your files into their User folders and then drag or copy them to another hard drive, USB external or flash drive. Here's how to drag, copy or move large groups of files: https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/2086566\/the-man... 4) Besides your files you should save a System Image back up to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:http:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/howto\/7363\/macrium-ref... You can even use the Macrium program to mount and extract files from this image so it can serve as both image and file backup too.I hope this helps.

All three of these devices work as expected with Microsoft Family settings.The laptop I mentioned in my original post is a new Lenovo Flex 6 14 Series 2-in-1 Touchscreen Laptop. The laptop had Windows Home pre-installed.After creating my user account (using my Microsoft account to login to the Lenovo laptop), I upgraded the laptop to Windows 10 Professional.\u00a0Once Windows 10 Professional was installed, I performed all available Windows updates, bringing it to version 1903 (May 2019 update).I am able to login to my user account (an Administrator account), and administrator group functionality appears to function correctly on my account.The laptop did not have any third-party AntiVirus or Security software installed. I have an active BitDefender subscription with open PC spaces and planned on installing BitDefender once the laptop was functioning as expected.I'm reluctant to remove my son's Microsoft account from my family group, because I do not want to inadvertently reset parental control settings that are active and working correctly on the other three devices on the account.Since my child's account has only existed on the laptop for about one week, rather than replacing the NTUser.dat file with a copy from another user account, I decided to remove my son's account from the laptop, including the entirety of his user directory.\u00a0However, even after removing his account and recreating it, the same problem persists. (I did not scrub user accounts from the Registry, so if there are account settings in the Registry associated with his UUID, then it is likely that deleting his account from the computer did not flush out whatever datapoint is presenting Windows Family from properly working with the Lenovo laptop.\u00a0My next step at this point is to try using a copy of the Default user's NTUser.dat file to see if that resolves the matter.If that does not work, I am thinking of adding a local administrator account unassociated with any Microsoft.com account. From that account, I can then remove all other user accounts, including the inactive\/hidden ones that are automatically added when adding an account with Microsoft Family group.I will post an update once I move forward.","Same issue here.I removed my child from the family and from the PC.Then re-added to family and PC.Problem persists.My other child account works well on the same PC. Very confounding.","What are people meant to do when this doesn't work?\u00a0 Especially on an important issue like this.I am having the exact same problem.Have spent hours trying to fix it.Even re-installed Windows 10.Made no difference.Have Microsoft got an answer for this.\u00a0 Its quite exhausting trying to solve something that makes no sense and where there is no real help.","Sadly Family Safety is not safe for your family, it is not reliable, has NEVER worked properly and breaks continuously.https:\/\/michaels.me.uk\/parents-beware-microsoft-family-safety-is-anything-but-safe\/","I am having the same problem, but only with one child's account out of 3.

Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...
