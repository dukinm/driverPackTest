It looks like it is logging in I will see the words \"preparing local session manager \" next to the spinning gears and then I will get a black screen and then I am right back at the login screen. I can log in to my Local account on that computer no problem. I have tried signing in using my pin and using my password and the same thing happens. I have tried running chkdsk from my local account and chkdsk did not find any problems. I ran DISM and it did not find any problems either. I ran sfc \/scannow which found some corrupt files and repaired them but it still not the main problem that I have been having. Using my local account I also installed some windows updates and that did not fix the problem. I also tried booting into safe mode and that did not work either. When I try to uninstall the feature update from Windows RE I get an error message like \"The feature could not be found\". I cannot roll back the update because it has been more than 10 days since I did the upgrade. I have an image of the SSD where windows was installed so I could restore from the backup and then try the upgrade again as a last resort. I rather not go through the trouble of doing that though. Thank you, hope you can help me.\u00a0","solutions":["Hi Jack.

This is a new installation of Windows 10 with the latest patches.\u00a0 I inserted a new blank DVD+R 4.7GB disk into my CD\/DVD\/BlueRay drive and in File Explorer and copied data files to it and selected the Manage Drive Tools from the top menu.\u00a0 I chose to burn as a mastered data disk.\u00a0 The only available Recording speed was 16x which matched the specs on my DVD drive and the blank disk.The files were properly burned to disk; however, Drive Tools indicated that there was a problem with the disk.\u00a0 I double checked the files and they were indeed burned as binary duplicates.\u00a0 I can live with an error message; however, when I tried to burn another set of files to another new disk within a few minutes of verifying the first set of files the only available Recording speed was 2.4x.\u00a0 I rebooted my computer thinking that perhaps File Explorer Manage Drive Tools feature had somehow become unstable due to it's stated error condition, but no effect...now the only Recording speed is 2.4x.\u00a0 I've had this problem before and after a few stated successful burns by the Drive Tools the speed increases.\u00a0 But, I have to suffer through very slow burning speeds for some of the burn activity.So, File Explorer Manage Drive Tools is storing some data somewhere that is being subsequently read by it and thus forcing the Recording speed to 2.4x regardless of the capability of the DVD burner and inserted media.\u00a0 And storing what it perceives as successful burning and increases the speed.
