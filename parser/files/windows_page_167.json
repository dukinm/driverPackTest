After going through a year of trying to liberate my parent's Yahoo account from ATT they haven't had for years, I would recommend anyone who finds themselves in this situation not waste the hours I have trying sort it out with Support Levels 1-2-3 but instead simply start a perfect new Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo account to free yourself.

Your account was set up successfully\", but then about 5 seconds later a message pops up \"Your Verizon account settings are out-of-date\".\u00a0 \u00a0 Then when I go to look in my still-empty Inbox, a yellow banner pops up across the top of the Mail screen \"We couldn't access this account: Verizon.\u00a0 You might need to update your password or give the account permission to sync to this device\".\u00a0 \u00a0I'm 100% sure the password is correct.\u00a0 \u00a0 (I can get using webmail just fine)Only then does it give me the option to change the server settings.\u00a0 \u00a0I guess the Mail app assumes a set of default server settings based on the email address that's input (?)Interestingly - it appears that just today the default settings have changed for verizon.net accounts.\u00a0 \u00a0Yesterday the default was:\u00a0- pop.aol.com for incoming\u00a0- smtp.aol.com for outgoingToday it is now:\u00a0- imap.mail.yahoo.com for incoming\u00a0- smtp.mail.yahoo.com for outgoingThough it doesn't seem to matter what server addresses I use - none of them work.Thanks for your help, by the way - it is appreciated.","Hi jagstock My name is Jon and I am an independent technical adviser.

I'm doing this for my attempts:Still not working though.I think the problem is this - AOL apparently has some uniqueness to the way they do IMAP protocol, that has to be accounted for in the email client.\u00a0 \u00a0Other email clients support this, but it appears MS Mail does not.I was able to get this working on Android, and iOS.\u00a0 \u00a0In both of those cases when setting up an email account on the client, there is an explicit entry for AOL.Android:iOS:However MS Mail has no such entry for AOL:Instead you have to use the generic \"Other account\" account type, but that's not working.\u00a0 (I did try Yahoo, since I know there's some affiliation with AOL, but that didn't work either)I'd love to be able to get this working on my Windows 10 PC, but have yet to figure out a way to do it.\u00a0 \u00a0FWIW I'm trying other email clients, e.g. Thunderbird, but not able to get it working there yet either.\u00a0 \u00a0I'd like to be able to use MS Mail if possible still.Thanks."]},{"symptom":"Time zone of Find my Device        What's the timezone of the time stamp on Find my Device?

Here's a list of answers that would be useless since I've tried them already:Tried installing drivers \"manually\" via device manager's own tool, resulting in windows saying that I already have the most recent drivers;That involved countless restarts especially because sometimes windows says I need to restart to complete the installation and sometimes it doesn't say that;Tried using all my USB 3.0 and 2.0 (front, rear, blue, etc.) ports, with and without the extension cable and nothing changed;Tried installing the controller drivers before installing the adapter and vice-versa, code 10 persisted on the adapter either wayr;Disabled all my USB 3.0 ports on mobo making them all 2.0 and nothing changed;Installed other chipset drivers from mobo website, nothing changed;Installed and re-installed all my USB controller drivers (which both 3.0 and 2.0 seems to be installed correcly anyway);Even tried using a \"driver manager software\" such as iobit driver booster to no avail;Tried installing drivers \"manually\" by choosing from the list of drivers already on my PC in device manager, that still results in code 10;Tried installing all the compatible different drivers manually from the microsoft update catalog and code 10 still persists;Tried installing drivers from other users' machines, most notably two drivers that circulate the internet as the most popular solutions on Youtube, so if the solution involves this video:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8mHjN2M7uiU\u00a0\/ this video:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=HBeMry0MmKE\u00a0\/ or this steam post:\u00a0https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/discussions\/forum\/1\/490123938430246727\/?ctp=24\u00a0I have already tried that and nothing has changed;Wanted to try turning off the \"allow computer to disable this device to save energy\" solution, that exists in this post:\u00a0https:\/\/windowsreport.com\/xbox-wireless-controller-error-code-10-windows-10\/\u00a0but that is impossible since when I click on the properties of the adapter in device manager THERE IS NO POWER MANAGEMENT tab. That tab exists in other devices such as USB ports and other network adaptors but not on the xbox adapter;The closest thing I could do, was find and disable that setting in the USB hub the adapter is connected in, as expected nothing changed;The second closest thing the selective suspending setting, which changes absolutely nothing regarding the error;Tried to mess with bios settings in order to see if the mobo didn't want me to manage the power settings of my USB ports, so I enabled wake on keyboard, mouse and LAN (there is no such setting as \"wake on USB\" on my gigabyte GA-B75M-D3H\u00a0rev. 1.0, bios F15);To enable the power management tab I tried to change the CsEnabled registry entry in current control set \/ control \/ power (as instructed in another post in another community:\u00a0https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/surface\/forum\/all\/power-management-tab-is-missing-from-device\/0a3c563a-5ec7-4809-9609-4bc257444590) to 0 only to find out that the entry was already 0 (changing it to 1 does nothing apparently);Disabled selective usb suspension on my power plan settings;Checked for the existence of \"upperfilter\" registry entry on the current control \/ class registry entry, (apparently removing\/adding that entry solves the code 10 issue on some mouses and keyboards as this video states:\u00a0https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Tw23bOto_Go) but the entry doesn't exist at all;So I tried the opposite of the last suggestion and added the registry entry, and as expected windows told me that the entry was invalid and would be removed;Despite already having Windows 10 version 1093, I tried updating to the last cumulative updates and nothing changed;Against my better judgement I decided to go for a fresh install of the 1093 windows (I have done it twice actually), last KB and all, still gives me the code 10 or code 48 when installed from safe mode;Tried running \"troubleshooter\" from the devices and printers section in control panel, and as expected the troubleshooter can't find a solution;Tried following the redundant advice from device manager that says \"you have already the most recent driver, try looking for updates in windows update\";Installed the xbox accessories app from windows store, but it can only update the controller firmware;Tried enabling the Xbox Accesories Manager service on services.msc, but nothing happened;Tried disabling all non Microsoft services and processes to see if anything was creating a conflict and nothing changed;Googled for 4 days for different solutions especially in this community only to find predictable answers like \"install driver\";Spent an ungodly amount of time using the \"troubleshooting\" instructions here:\u00a0https:\/\/support.xbox.com\/pt-BR\/xbox-on-windows\/accessories\/troubleshoot-xbox-wireless-adapter-for-windows, but they are either things I've already done without success or they lead to a link saying \"your device might be broken, click here for replacement\", but the link is broken and it sends me to an error page;Tried following the support page here\u00a0https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/310123\/error-codes-in-device-manager-in-windows\u00a0that supposedly explains what each error code is and what is the solution, but the \"explanation\" of the code 10 is \"driver error\" and the solution is \"reinstall drivers (*sigh*)\";Tried \"registering\" my product in xbox support channel, but apparently the site don't want me to do that, always returning an error.These are current my system specs in case the solution may involve any conflict(?).

So that is not an option either, I need the adapter for wireless use in any capacity.I still haven't tried connecting it to another computer, because I don't have any other computer here. I will have access to a Thinkpad laptop tomorrow to do another battery of tests, but I don't really think the adapter is broken because windows recognizes the adapter correctly, it just refuses to \"start\" the device.\u00a0Also, if the solution is somehow \"rollback to a previous windows version\" I'll\u00a0 be very very mad, because the only reason I updated to 1903 was to check the Xbox Game Pass beta, and it would be absurd to have to choose between playing games or using a controller.Also, if it helps in any way, before formatting my hard drive twice, I was using a xbox 360 wireless adapter, and it worked just fine. I'm only \"upgrading\" my peripherals because my old 360 controllers are broken.Even if the adapter is somehow broken, I would need to be redirected to replacement of the product in Brazil (REAL REPLACEMENT, please, because the link for product replacement in the brazillian website leads to an error screen as I've said before). I have bought the device from Amazon and retrieved it in Florida, but I cannot return the product to the US now, because I'm not there and shipping would involve absurd costs.\u00a0 Also, I bought the controller and adapter on a bundle and I don't think I can return just the adapter.\u00a0Right now, I'm very disappointed with this product and I'm pretty desperate for good, creative and effective solutions, especially because while browsing for solutions I've found other users in the same pickle as I am asking in reddit, steam forums, microsoft forums, tom's hardware etc. so this issue should've been fixed by now, it is unnaceptable for Microsoft to ship Microsoft hardware that has driver issues with Microsoft OS and Microsoft software.*****Moved to Windows 10 Devices & Drivers by moderator*****","solutions":["Hi\u00a0Braescher,Thanks for reaching out to us in the Xbox Forums for this issue.

I mean even if you Restart the PC or I have a program called Process Explorer that I used to replace Task Manager with, and I go to File > Shutdown > Log Off, it does a Restart but then it opens with the Windows log-on page saying ADMINISTRATOR -\u00a0WELCOME in the middle where it usually has my Name and wants my password and there is no way to change who you are.Luckily, I finally figured out a trick but it only worked since I use OmniPass password software which also pops a box on that same screen up at the top since it is designed to automatically log a user in to OmniPass when they log in to Windows each time. My trick was to fill in my User ID which is my outlook.com email address, hit tab and it put automatically added \"Microsoft Account\" into a box titled Domain, and then I typed in my outlook.com password.

Perhaps if someone else in my family hits that icon?

If it doesn't, then obviously this Question was the wrong one to follow originally and I should change the registry back to what it was set at since it isn't doing what I want and it is too risky to have the icon on the desktop prior to logging in as me that lets anyone who wants to, to log in to my computer as some generic Administrator and mess things up along with the fact that then I need to figure out later how to have it not automatically log me in as that generic Administrator everytime in the future until I take the steps that I listed in my last Reply and that's IF I remember what to do.The problem is though, I can't remember what the 10 digit number was that the Value had been set to and I thought that I'd written it in an earlier Reply of mine and maybe even added a PrintScreen image or photo but I don't find one here or anywhere.
