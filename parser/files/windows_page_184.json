Of course this behavior, being full unexpected and full hidden, puts the user in a long period of doubt and fruitless search for solution.Diego gave on 07 Oct 2012 aTotal protection against these Keyboard Layout changes from nearby computers, which is immediately, totally, and reliably effective:In RegEdit, navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Keyboard Layout, in right pane right-click and choose \"New\" then \"DWORD Value\", name it \"IgnoreRemoteKeyboardLayout\", then double-click it and under \"Value data\" type \"1\" (don't mind \"Hexadecimal\" or \"Decimal\", either will do).Versailles, Thu 29 Jun 2017 17:42:10 +0200","I tried \u00a0Michel method by adding the DWORD in the regedit, as well as check the Preload in HKEY_CURRENT_USERS, but I still have Vietnamese Keyboard automatically adding to my language bar, even though in my language or keyboard setting there is no Vietnamese added.

My name is Joseph. I'm an independent advisor. I'll be happy to help you out today.May I know what is the specification of your PC? Thank you!","Your issue is probably going to be BIOS and\/or driver-related. Since you are running an OS the system was never designed for, the best thing you can do isupdate your BIOS - F.2E [hp.com]. If that does not resolve the issue, you need to find a compatible mix of Intel and Nvidia graphics drivers that will work together. I believe you have attempted the latest drivers you could find. You could also try utilizing only the latest Windows 8.x drivers from HP's site for the 4000 and GT630m to see if that combination works. Ultimately the Microsoft generic display adapter might be the only driver that is stable in your configuration. You might check in your BIOS to see if any graphics adapter toggles exist that might change how the on board graphics operates or is detected. You may also want to reach out to HP to see if they have a known-driver combination available for that model for Windows 10.In regards to your wireless issue, make sure that wireless is not disabled where it is running in an airplane type mode, not picking up any access points. You can also try updating your drivers. I believe theseLenovo ones [lenovo.com]\u00a0are a copy of the latest 7.x series of driver compatible with your Broadcom hardware.","Hi Techfreak_I appreciate your help in both the issues.I will post again after checking if it works or not.\u00a0at this time I wanted to add to the Wlan adapter issue:i used the windows troubleshooter, it told me that wifi cabability is not enabled. it also suggested to use the on\/off button on the keyboard.I can see the wifi on\/off button in amber color, when i press it, I see airplane mode on\/off notification on screen but not for wifi.the button led never come up in white color.","Hi Techfreak_it worked.it worked for my WLAN.i used the bios setup that you shared above. but i used my own drivers.here is the link to the drivers that worked.https:\/\/1drv.ms\/u\/s!AmsidZLBZkkvhdEdkyidy87_dNQ6sg?e=HNZYBFyour efforts really helped me.now I need to fix my NVIDIA card. i will follow what you suggested and update the result.thank you for helping me out for WLAN issue.\u00a0","Dear Techfreak_This post is to thank you as you helped me solve both the issues I was having after upgrading to windows 10 Pro 64 bit.You suggested to update the BIOS and then use the windows 8 drivers from HP (as I have HP notebook).you also suggested to use Intel HD drivers and NVIDIA drivers from same site, as there is chance of both being compatible.And YES they both are compatible.\u00a0I have un-installed the drivers first and installed after reboot.My WLAN and NVIDIA graphic card both are working fine now.At last, I would like to thank you to guide me fixing the issue (more like a nightmare for me).Many Thanks!"]},{"symptom":"about microsoft store        my microsoft store\u00a0 doesnot\u00a0 download anything\u00a0","solutions":["* Merged my microsoft store doesnot download anything","Hi and thanks for reaching out!
