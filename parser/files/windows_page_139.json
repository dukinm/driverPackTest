I restarted computer and installed new drivers for the keyboard and mouse. I have now tested it for a few hours and it seems to have worked. I did however get two disconnects in the beginning but I think that maybe some USB drivers hadn't finished installing even though I waited 5-10 mins after I had logged into account on windows. I had to restart twice because I had on driver left to uninstall the first time since all USB hubs got uninstalled before I could remove it.I consider this problem solved now and the help is much appreciated.

Glad it's now working for you.","Hi again.Unfortunately the latest fix only worked for a day and then I had the same problem with the mouse disconnecting and reconnecting. So I tried doing the same and then that didn't work.Got anymore ideas on how to fix it?RegardsIsak","None.I began experiencing issues such as you now are. The solution was to purchase a new mouse.Recently, my sister experienced the same and purchased a new mouse.\u00a0That's my solution since any steps taken to resolve the issue always resulted in the mouse eventually stopped working again. Finally the new mouse took residence and all has been well since.","Can anyone help me too with this issue:I have an old Dell Tower - not sure how old it is but its works just fine and has Windows 10 and SSD installed - to\u00a0 me it does what it needs to do but this darn mouse and keyboard stuff stopping working with no rhyme or reason is making me very frustrated.I cannot easily unplug and plug in the mouse\/keyboard to get it going again... they are still lit up but they are dead basically and I have to do a hard reset.USB selective suspend is disabled.I checked the drivers for the keyboard and mouse and they are updated.I checked to see if PC has KB4074588 and it does not.I am not sure what else to do.... I can go days without the issue and then days where anytime I step away from the PC it stops working.I can say when it is working it just does not just stop\u00a0 ... only when I walk away and the machine is idle or the screen is locked.Any suggestions would be appreciated.","1. Go to Cortana Search and type MSconfigLook at your BiosThis will give you computer ageIf there were an update to the bios you can check at the computer manufacturer's website for the actual bios date.2.

Most of the time I can't reopen it & if I can it closes again seconds later. From then on the same thing will happen to anything I try to view (Netflix app, mail app etc). I'll look at it and within 10 seconds it'll close. What's strange is that if I'm watching a video on Firefox I can still hear it playing even when it closes and I can't open it again. Firefox is still working in the background according to task manager even though the icon on the taskbar doesn't show that it is open at all. The only way I can fix the problem is by restarting the computer, although 1\/10 times the problem persists and I have to restart a second time. I notice that a lot of the time this problem happens soon after coming out of sleep mode, although that's not the only time.

Laptop HP 8560p New Year's BSOD atikmpag.sys graphic drivers        I was using my laptop New Year\u2019s Day before going to bed in the morning and got a BSOD. I hope for the best but when the laptop rebooted (an HP Elitebook 8560p with win7 x64 SP1) the screen remained black. I wished myself happy New Year and went to bed. So the next day the issue remained. I plugged and external screen which works so I saw that the BSOD is about the\u00a0atikmpag.sys graphic drivers, which makes sense since the screen isn't working. So I booted in safe mode to delete (I just rename) the\u00a0atikmpag.sys and\u00a0atikmdag.sys files, then I can boot windows normally, but I have no graphic drivers and only the external screen works. I have updated and tried different driver versions, which doesn't solve the issue, updated BIOS, then I remembered my computer had rebooted on it's own once or twice in the last few days for windows updates and there was one on the 12\/31 but it was critical so I couldn\u2019t uninstall it, so I Rolled back to some automatic backup from the 29th it seemed I had yet the problem remains. Now my windows update go from 12\/25 KB4507004 to 01\/04 KB4531786.\u00a0I have also noticed that the \u201csleep\u201d function is greyed out, if that gives anyone a hint (I spent 5min trying to solve that one, they mentioned the BIOS, which is when I updated in case it also worked for the screen). I called HP who have made it clear that this is not faulty hardware so they can\u2019t help me, which too bad because they were real easy to get in contact with. So they gave me the number for Microsoft but I\u2019m not getting anywhere. I expect that there is just some issue between some code for the windows update and some hardware, but I doubt my case will ever get a fix since there are no more updates for Elitebook 8560p and Windows 7 will stop Jan 14th. I would like to know if anyone has solved this kind of problem, or if it can be solved at all. The laptop seems to be about 10 years old and maybe this is just a case of planned obsolescence, which would bum me out since I don\u2019t worship consumerism, but I would like to know if this can be fixed or if I\u2019m tilting at windmills.\u00a0Thanks for the help.","solutions":[]}]}
