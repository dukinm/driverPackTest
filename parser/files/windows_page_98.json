Under normal circumstances, input into a PIN box must benumeric. Anything else\u00a0is \"black balled\" as you say, i.e., it won't even show up. In a Password box, you do see it is the top-character getting typed. That should only happen when the SHIFT key is held - Caps Lock won't do it. Also, the shift key only affects the keyboard - not the numeric keypad. The numeric keypad only needs Caps Lock to be on. Somehow, when you switch back to the PIN, the number will be typed instead & will work.I find that...(a) Caps Lock & Num Lock both work in a Password box, & neither works in a PIN box.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 (They won't beep, but the light on Caps Lock works & there is a message saying it's on.)(b) Caps Lock doesn't affect the number keys on the keyboard,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 though it does reverse the effect of Shift on the letters.(c) If I turn Num Lock off, the numeric keypad is black balled in the Password box.(d) The PIN box still works, if I switched Num Lock off in the Password box & left it that way.I'm not sure what to make of it or what to suggest.

Sometimes all of them would map, sometimes half of them would map, and other times none of them except for her home drive would map. Also when she was in the office everything worked fine. I did confirm when she was at home that Direct Access was working just fine, and was able to ping our servers.\u00a0After having her troubleshoot her home network, we then re-imaged her computer she ended up having the same issue at home after her computer was re-imaged. Before her computer was re-imaged she was running 1903, I then re-imaged her to our latest 1909 image. She still had the issue at home after being re-imaged.
