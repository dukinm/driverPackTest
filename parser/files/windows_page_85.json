Or rather, it does not take the computer any longer to determine that your password is incorrect compared to it being correct. The work involved for the computer is, ideally, exactly the same. Any password verification scheme that takes a different amount of time based on whether the password is correct or incorrect can be exploited to gain knowledge, however small, of the password in less time than would otherwise be the case.The delay is an artificial delay to make repeatedly trying to gain access by using different passwords infeasible, even if you have some idea of what the password is and automatic account lockout is disabled (which it should be in most scenarios as it would otherwise allow for a trivial denial of service against an arbitrary account). The general term for this behavior is tarpitting. A tarpit is a service on a computer system (usually a server) that purposely delays incoming connections. The technique was developed as a defense against a computer worm, and the idea is that network abuses such as spamming or broad scanning are less effective, and therefore less attractive, if they take too long. Most likely, this issue still depends on your Computer Cache, Processing, etc. You might improve this if the main system files are installed in SSD (as per number of users compared to HDD) Please let me know if this clarifies your concern.
