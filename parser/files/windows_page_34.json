I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.It's a known issue we've been trying to get them to fix for months. To resolve it if you don't yet have a Pro Digital License assigned to the PC, go into Action Center by pressing Windows (flag) key + A and turn on Airplane Mode to go offline.Now insert the Pro Generic Version Key VK7JG-NPHTM-C97JM-9MPGT-3V66T in Settings > Update & Security > Activation > Change Product Key. This will change the version to Pro.Then go back online, insert the Pro Product Key in the same location to activate. If it already has a Digital License it should activate soon after going online.If any problems on Monday contact Microsoft Support by one of these phone numbers:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/405170...You can also go here: https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/... choose the link for Browser help, interact briefly about your exact problem, keep replying agent until it connects with an agent.I hope this helps.
