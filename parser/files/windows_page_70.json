This happens on two different Windows 10 devices I use. I use a smart card to access enterprise webmail on occasion and that works without issue. I do not use the smart card to log into my personal devices. The popups did not start on my new device until the first time I used the USB smart card reader.\u00a0I have not found anything that I am unable to do without hooking up the card and have no issues accessing the website that require the smart card so this is an annoyance not a capability breaking issue. I have seen similar questions asked multiple times without a clear resolution. I'm guessing that there is a setting somewhere that gets turned on when a smart card is introduced and I would like to disable it upon login.","solutions":["Hi Hoarder, Disable Smart Card Plug and Play Service Step 1 Hold down the \"Windows\" key and press \"R\" to open the Run dialog.
