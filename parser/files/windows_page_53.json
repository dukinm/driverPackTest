Sorry to hear you are experiencing issues and I would really like to help you find a resolution.If you don\u2019t have a webcam built-in or connected to the PC, you\u2019ll see a simple black screen that gives the 0X00F424 ee can\u2019t find your camera error.1] Check your webcam if it is installed correctly This is probably the first thing you need to check. Make sure your webcam\u2019s USB port is working properly. Try changing the USB port of your computer and see if that helps.2] Update the webcam driver If you are setting up your webcam for the first time, you need to install a driver to run it properly. You should find the corresponding driver for your webcam. If you have already installed your webcam driver but still receive this issue, may be its time to update your driver using device manager as follows: Windows 10 users should press Win+X and click on Device Manager entry in the list. Locate the camera device next. It should be an Imaging Device. Right-click on that driver and click on Update driver option. Next, select the option that says Search automatically for updated driver software option. It should not take a lot of time after that to finish the whole process.3] Uninstall the webcam driver and reinstall it If you face any issue during the driver updating, you might need to uninstall the webcam driver. To do this, open Device Manager > right-click on the device > select Properties > switch to Driver tab > click on Uninstall Device button.Restart your computer and then open Device Manager again and click on Action > Scan for hardware changes.4] Roll back webcam driver If your webcam has stopped working after installing a new update, you should uninstall the update and roll back to the older version. You will have to open Device Manager > right-click on the device > select Properties > switch to Driver tab > click on Roll Back Driver button > select Yes on the next window. After that, you need to restart your PC to check whether it is working or not.5] Detect outdated webcam driver If your webcam is designed before Windows 7, it might not work with Windows 10. To find this out, follow these subsequent steps-Open Device Manager > select the device and Properties from the right-click context-menu > switch to Driver tab > select Driver details. You will find some Driver files on your screen. Now check whether you have any stream.sys file or not. If you see such a file in the list, your webcam may not work with Windows 10. In that case, you need to buy a new one.Hope this helps.","The Windows store says the Camera is installed. on launching Camera App gives the error code 0X00F4244 the Camera is not installed.

Same if I just upgrade 7 to 10.So should I setup up all the Pcs with a local account only, or use my one Ms Account as an admin then create a user like the win7 pcs had and then load the backup in the local user account.None of my employees use Office365 and email is all browser based.\u00a0 So all the PCs need to do is browse and open pdfs and quickbooks shared off the server PC.","solutions":["Hi gregg1981, I am an independent advisor and a Microsoft user like you, and I would be happy to help you out with this.While the latest build of Windows 10 does want you to create a new Microsoft account, there is a workaround that will trick it into allowing the creation of a local account upon installation.You can do this by unplugging the network cable temporarily, or disabling the wifi (or putting it in airplane mode) before starting the setup process.I have had it where I connected the computer to wifi, and it forced a Microsoft account, and then even if I tried to back out, I could not disconnect it from wireless so had to start the whole installation process over again in order to get the local option back. This should also address your question about the backups as you can create the local account with the same name as the previous username, which will create a regular local directory under C:\\UsersI hope this has helped you.

I'm in the military and use a CAC CARD reader to access websites. After a recent windows update, my computer no longer detects my CAC CARD. The card reader is fine, but the card itself isn't detecting. I REPEAT, the card reader is fine. (Also, its NOT an SD card. Its a CAC card. On an other post here, a fix was suggested for an SD card. Its not an SD card).The card reader is detected, I've updated and reinstalled the driver multiple times. I've tried rolling it back. The card reader shows on the computer under Device Manager, it shows on other computers too, and the CAC Card works on other computers. It is not a problem with the card reader, or the card, it is a problem with some settings in this computer. Internet explorer, google chrome, and firefox all fail to see the CAC Card on this computer.
