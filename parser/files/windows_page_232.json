Modify the value of \"Attributes\" from 1 to 2. A value of 2 will make \"System unattended sleep timeout\" appear in the advanced power settings under \"sleep.\" Notice the default value is 2 minutes for both battery and plugged in.(Screenshot wouldn't paste here)Change the values to whatever you want them set to. I made mine match the \"Sleep after\" settings. Some people have reported that the settings will return to the defaults (2 minutes) occasionally. I have not experienced that yet but I will update this post if it does. I suspect they may have changed the power plan and forgot to change the defaults. Your changes will not carry across plans.Basically what is happening is your PC is being woke up in an unattended state so it defaults to the\u00a0\"System unattended sleep timeout\" settings instead of the \"Sleep after\" settings. An unattended state is usually when the PC wakes of to do a task like Windows Updates or a wake on LAN (WoL) event. I'm not sure why the\u00a0\"System unattended sleep timeout\" setting is used when I wake the PC with mouse movement, but the steps above seem to have solved my issue.Everything goes fine until I attempt to edit \"Attributes\" from 1 to 2.

Soon after that, my CPU started being used at 100%. I was thinking I somehow got a virus so I tried scanning my pc with Norton (my anti virus) but it couldn't finish without crashing. I decided to reset the pc and wipe it completely but for some reason it wouldn't work. It would do nothing then it would soon crash. So I reformatted the hard drives and got a copy of Windows 10 on a usb and download it that way. Downloaded drivers and I couldn't tell it there was any crashing so I download a couple of things (Steam, Discord, Norton). The CPU issue was fixed but I still kept crashing. But, the crashing used to be very often and could hardly do anything but now it's just very random could happen from anywhere from 5 mins, 10, 30, 1 hour or more after being turned on. I'm lost at what I should try to do and would be much appreciated if someone could help some this issue.Also, it sometimes freezes for about 3-4 minutes then crashes\u00a0and I've already posted this before but the person helping me never got back to me.","solutions":["Hi BootKickerDABB, I am Rob, an independent and a 14 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis.

This sounds like an intermittant heat related issue which does not necessarily mean excessive heat. A single component, such as a resistor, capacitor, transistor, or others, could be too sensitive to even the normal levels of heat.1. Totally uninstall Norton - 3rd party antivirus tend to create these issues and\/or make troubleshooting much more difficult.

Do not rely on Windows Updates for this, Actually go to the motherboard and all the major device makers' sites and manually check. (See drive update methods below.)3. Remove ALL power then reseat all the cards. memory, and cables (on both ends when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Add a fan blowing into the case onto the COU and GPU areas as a test. <--- These are very important especially since the BSOD's were present before the hardware changes and survived a Clean Install of Windows. <-- This also needs to be done even though you might think it is not the cause.4. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible including minimum memory. 5. Run the memory tests (see methods below). 6. As needed use ALL the methods in the troubleshooters below. 7. After ALL the above if needed run Driver Verifier to see if it can indicate a CAUSE (see Driver Verifier methods below).----------------------------------------------------------- Troubleshoot blue screen errors <-- read this link http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/t...Frankly, I would be very surprised if analyzing the minidumps helps at all though it is worth a shot.

For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more. http:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/driverview.htmlFor Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
