Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. If a problem doesn't happen in safe mode, this means that default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue. Observing Windows in safe mode enables you to narrow down the source of a problem, and can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC.You can follow steps on the link below on how to boot into safe mode and how to remove the drivershttps:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-ph\/help\/12376\/...https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-hardwa...Let me know how it goes."]},{"symptom":"Windows        I turned my pc on and all my settings had been cleared and my desktop was cleared, everything was still on my pc but every application had logged out, Chrome, Steam etc and I've had to go through a lot of trouble setting everything back up, whats happened and what (if I can) can i do to get everything back to how it was","solutions":["Hi Eoin. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Sometimes if the User account gets corrupted and cannot start, Windows will sign you into a temporary account. A Temp Account cannot be used as a normal account so do not set it up or copy files into it because at any restart it might decide to start into your old Account. I'll give you everything that can be done to repair or replace your account, based on helping countless others get through it.1) Try restarting the PC a few times to see if it can sign into your account. 2) Check at C:\\Users if you can see your old account with its files intact. If not check at C:\\Windows.old to see if files were archived there during a version install that fails.If so copy the files out externally so they are safe. Files should always be backed up if you value them at all. You can copy or drag them to an external USB flash or hard drive, or into Onedrive (up to 5gb free) or Google Drive (up to 15gb free).3) From the temp account try to repair the old account using one of these methods:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/48012-fix-y...https:\/\/winaero.com\/blog\/windows-10-youve-been-...4) If not then you can try to create a new Admininstrator Local Account to see how it works:https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/for.... 5) If necessary to try to repair the old account or create a new Account you may need to enable and sign into the Hidden Administrator account used only for emergencies, using one of these methods:https:\/\/www.isumsoft.com\/it\/enable-hidden-admin...https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2969-enable....6) If no other method works you may need to create Windows installation media to boot into to access the Command Prompt at boot to perform Option 5 above, or do a Reset:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m.... Detailed steps to boot media are in the tutorial in Step 12 below.7) Once the new account is created: sign into the new account, move your files over, test that all programs run. If you decide to keep it then you can delete the old accounts when ready in Settings > Accounts > Family and other Users.8) If the install is too corrupted for even a new account to run well or you want to invest the time in trying to fix the old account, then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... 9) If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/4-ways-boot-saf... 10) If nothing else works to fix the install try running a Repair Install which reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files, programs and most settings in place, by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This will solve most problems and also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... 11) If those fail then you can do a Reset: http:\/\/www.laptopmag.com\/articles\/reset-windows... 12) Or you can use the bootable media from Step 6 to do the vastly superior Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.If you have files that aren't backed up you can use the same bootable media to rescue your files using this method:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial. It's a better install than any amount of money could buy.I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.

THEN below it a big red 'RESEND NOTIFICATION' button.All settings for notifications and permissions are set on the phone, yet NO notification ever gets recieved from the pc to the phone, no matter how many times i send the thing. Once this is redone (losing count of the nuymber of times its being sent) the yellow banner stating 'Make sure your phone and PC are connected to the internet.' THEY BOTH ARE!!!!!!!It's always the same error time after time after time. I've even had the phone sitting within an INCH of the bluetooth adaptor (even tho i can send an image from the pc to phone\/phone to pc directly via bluetooth from across the room) Is the bluetooth even needed, or is it all done through wifi now, all i know is im now getting fed up with it, and thinking of going for a better and WORKING alternative, and removing this crappy app altogether"]},{"symptom":"Lumia 635        i am trying to remove photos from my wifes Nokia Lumia 635 and load them on my windows 10 laptop. keep getting error message.","solutions":["Hello AngelRivera7, I'm Didi, an independent advisor.
