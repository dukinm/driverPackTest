{"windows":[{"symptom":"How does a local account get associated with the Microsoft personal account used to sign in with?        Currently, when I sign in with my Microsoft account \"*** Email address is removed for privacy ***\" and do whoami I see that I am local user dave. Also when I run netplwiz I see that \"*** Email address is removed for privacy ***\" shows as local user dave along with the Full Name I setup for user dave.Unfortunately I created the local account dave right after setting up a new Windows 10 Pro system and did not check whoami or netplwiz before I setup that dave local account.My questions are 1) what would the default account be if no local account was setup and 2) when signing in with a Microsoft account, does Windows create a new local account using the portion of the email address before the @ character?So in general, how does signing in with a Microsoft account associate with a local account in order to support NTFS and other classic Windows permissions like file shares etc.Thanks, Dave","solutions":["Hi Dave. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.The two are entirely separate. This article explains the difference: https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/should-you-use-...There isn't anything you can't do in Sharing with a Local Account vs. a Microsoft Account, except that the MS account is an easier way to connect to OneDrive. But you can connect to OneDrive or any other app by signing into it individually with a Local Account.At any time you can switch from a Local Account to a MS account in Settings > Accounts > Your Info > Sign in with a Microsoft Account Instead, or vice versa.There is no other default account besides the one you set up when you install Windows (always an Admin acct, btw, which is wise) or set up a new PC that comes with Windows. It can be a Local or Microsoft Account. To set up a Local Account during install or Setup after Version 1909 disconnect from the internet to force the choice. I hope this helps.

Please reread the questions, and try the whoami and netplwiz commands to understand what I am asking.What account does whoami show when you sign in with a Microsoft account?What account does netplwiz show underneath the Microsoft account?Microsoft accounts are kind of like a new veneer on top of the classic Windows permissions system.For me it shows my local account and its Full Name even though I logged in with my Microsoft personal account. Unfortunately it is too late to see what accounts those commands show had I not created that local account. I'm not sure how they got associated w\/ each other is my question.Also, I would argue the legacy\/classic accounts are properly called local accounts, not local offline accounts...who's offline anymore? And you can create the same local account (user\/pw) on multiple computers which helps workgroup file sharing work w\/o domains.Dave","Dave, perhaps I misunderstood your question which is not really clear. You asked what would the default account be if no local account was setup? The answer is that you must set up a Local Account or a Microsoft Account, there is no default account other than a built-in hidden Admin account used for emergencies.Under my MS account I see the Guest Account which is hidden. If netplwiz shows a Local Account for you in addition to a MS account then it means you created a Local Account. It doesn't create a Local account or anything else as default for a MS account.I don't know what you mean by offline account. You use your same account whether you're online or offline. You can go offline during Setup to force it to let you create a Local Account, which ability was removed in V.1909.I hope I made this clear. But if I am not understanding the question then please clarify.","Greg,I setup both a MSFT acct\u00a0\"*** Email address is removed for privacy ***\"\u00a0and a local account dave on a new Win10 Pro install.When I sign in using my MSFT acct -1) netplwiz shows administrator which I enabled, and my MSFT account. It does not show the local dave account that I also setup. When I double click the MSFT acct it shows the local acct \"underneath\".2) whoami however shows my local dave account.Did you try running the above two programs? What did you get?I am wondering 1) what would have happened if I never setup the local dave account and what would whoami say then? That acct is likely what is used for classic\/legacy permissions I should think but am not sure. And 2) is there a default account created to \"back\" the MSFT account under the covers if no local acct was setup? Does it somehow match a local acct using the first part of the email address in the MSFT acct if one was setup such? What would Users and Groups show after logging in with a MSFT acct had no local account been setup?I've done detailed complex software development on Windows in about every language since the very first release of Windows in 1985 but I did retire a couple years ago, and never dug into this new sign in system very deep, but now want to know how it works under the covers.Basically it seems quite the kludge underneath and I want to know how it works esp. in conjunction with the legacy permissions that are still there and still used. And don't get me started on the different types of Microsoft aka Personal, and Business aka Work or School accounts as I think only one MSFT type of account should have been created but that is a whole 'nother discussion...Thanks, DaveP.S. \"Under my MS account I see the Guest Account which is hidden\" - I don't know what you mean by this. How do you see it, if it is hidden? And what are you looking at where\/when you see it?","The built-in Admin should remain hidden except in emergencies. It should not be used as a regular operating account of any kind.WhoamI command shows my one and only account, but by an older name. It's not really that useful for Windows, meant for Linux mainly.","Greg,That would be quite the Catch-22 if by hidden you mean disabled since if I needed the account, I could not use it when disabled, and I needed it recently, and never use it as a \"regular\" account. There is no more risk to the Administrator proper than any other administrator account imo. In any event, not my concern here and my computers and accounts are well protected.So back to the subject, what does netplwiz show when you double click it? The same local account as whoami? Your Guest account? If so it seems that the whoami user is who you are really running as per the old Win32 framework. Not sure that it matters though depending on what all they did to support the MSFT sign ins which is what I'm trying to figure out.Humor me, and tell me -* what the name of the whoami user account?* what is the name of the underlying account of the MSFT account that netplwiz shows when double clicking?* does the local acct name shown by whoami and netplwiz match your email MSFT acct sign email in in any pattern or fashion? The only local account, only local enabled account etc.?* does the Local Users and Groups have that account as a user and is it enabled or disabled?* does the Group column that netplwiz shows for your MSFT account show the same groups that the whoami account belongs to in the Local Users and Groups?P.S. it was the article you referenced that called local accounts, local offline accounts, not me.Thanks, Dave","Whoami shows \"Dell\/Old\", a Local Account User name from a time when I briefly changed MS account to a Local Account, and then changed it back.Netplwiz shows MS Account User name. In Netplwiz, if I tick the box to force use of password, then doubleclick on the one existing User (MS) account, it shows the old User name and cannot be edited.\"Old\" name used briefly for User account doesn't have any relation at all to my MS Account email address.When accessing the User Profile as shown in Option One here: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/69127-delet... it shows a Default Profile and Dell\/Old which is the Local Account I'd briefly changed into from my only MS Account and then changed back. Netplwiz shows my one listed account as a member of Admin group. There is always confusion about Local Profile vs Local Account because they differ slightly, Shawn's tutorial above explains it somewhat but I try to stay away from it in forums because it quickly confuses visitors.","Thx Greg, I'll read that article.","keep me posted on your progress as I will be here to help until the case is resolved.","Greg, thanks for sticking with this.

So we dropped it since it was his old computer anyways...Now he complains that his computer keeps restarting for no reason, and I found out that it's because it's trying to update windows which is now running version 1607, and it wants to update to 1903.It starts to update and reboots a few times after which it says that it goes back to the old version again. And so it goes again and again if you try to update it...His father gave him this computer, and I don't know how or where they got this Windows, but when I try to alter different things on his computer, it sometimes say that I dont have permission because of some kind of group policy..Anyone know how to fix any of this, reinstalling windows or getting the updates?And what about installing a new windows..
