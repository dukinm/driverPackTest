Well, that's why I wholeheartedly recommend switching your memory dump settings to \"Complete Memory Dump,\" so that it's easier for you to debug (find out) the causes of Blue Screens (bug checks) as you'll have a complete dump of the RAM at the time of the crash. By default, Windows only dumps the kernel memory space, which is useful for some crashes, but it's not perfect, as some blue screens are caused by processes or modules outside the kernel memory space. A complete memory dump has none of these issues, because it's quite literally an entire dump of all the physical RAM in the system.NOTE: A complete memory dump takes up a LOT more space on your computer's storage device compared to the default \"Automatic\" or \"Kernel\" memory dumps. More specifically, a complete memory dump will take up the amount of storage space equivalent to the amount of RAM installed. (Example: Let's say you have 8 gigabytes of RAM. The complete memory dump will be 8 gigabytes.)\u00a0Despite this, it's not as big of a deal as some may make it out to be, as the memory dumps don't stack (by default every time a complete dump occurs, the previous one is overwritten) and it's only 8 gigs of space you need to take up. While I know some devices are storage constrained (and for those devices, like anything below 100 gigs, I would recommend sticking to an automatic memory dump, all other devices, complete) the small cost is worth it for better debug ability.Now here's what you do:1) In the Start menu in Windows 7 or 10 (or Start screen in Windows 8 or 8.1), search for Control Panel, and open it.2) Go to System and Security -> System -> then click on Advanced system settings.3) Click settings under Startup and Recovery.Bonus tip: I would also highly recommend disabling automatic restart here by unticking the checkbox. This is because if the computer does crash, you can see what the error code is, and look it up to find out the problem.4) Where it says \"Write debugging information,\" click the drop down and change \"Automatic memory dump\" (Kernel in windows 7), to Complete Memory Dump. Then click apply and ok.It will ask for a reboot, so if you want to, go ahead and do so.That's it! That's how you enable a complete memory dump in Windows.\u00a0","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"When trying to activate you get 0xC004F074 with description \"The Key Management Server (KMS) is unavailable\"        When trying to activate you get 0xC004F074 with description \"The Key Management Server (KMS) is unavailable\"I have been running windows 10 pro for 4 years with an active license.

You were given a KMS license, which is also known as a volume license. This type of license is sold to organizations that buy Windows licenses in large quantities.\u00a0A computer with a KMS license must be in regular contact with the organization's KMS server to maintain its activation, otherwise the copy of Windows loses its activation, which is what happened in your case.The correct type of license for an individual user is either an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) license - which is what you get when you buy a computer from a computer manufacturer - or a Retail license - which is what you get when you build a computer and purchase a copy of Windows on your own.This unfortunate situation sometimes happens when an unscrupulous repair shop re-installs Windows with a stolen or hacked KMS license. In any case, now you need to buy a Retail license and do a clean install of Windows.If, in fact, your computer was recently repaired, you ought to complain to the repair shop. I say this because, if you originally purchased your computer from a computer manufacturer, your computer came with a valid OEM license. In that case, the only way for it to lose that license is if someone removed the original copy of Windows and replaced it with a KMS-licensed copy of Windows. An OEM license doesn't spontaneously become a KMS license, and no update from Microsoft would do that.WARNING: The web page recommended by the Independent Advisor contains a link to well-known harmful software called Reimage Plus.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.A laptop is made up of hardware so unless hardware fails you can always repair or reinstall Windows and will probably have a much better install than the one you had. There is ALWAYS a way to boot the media even if the auto repair functions won't respond. If not then we troubleshoot until it boots. I've never seen a single case out of over a hundred thousand I've handled in forums where media could not be made to boot as long as the hardware is still good.Here are steps to recover from failed Updates or Version Update install which causes Windows to fail to start or function. If any steps won't work then report back and move on to the next. At least one step will always work, leading up to if necessary doing an automated Reset or a gold standard Clean Install: 1) Try whichever method works in this tutorial link to get into Advanced Startup Options to run System Restore or Uninstall Updates button, or if this is a version update Go Back to Old Version:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2294-advanc.... Easiest is to restart or force shutdown the PC 3 times to force it into Repair Mode.If you are able to access System Restore or Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.2) If necessary borrow another PC and follow the steps in the middle of this download page to create bootable installation media to access the repair options if not accessible by any other method:http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m.... The bootable media is also the only method that doesn't require the password if you're stuck on that.Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: https:\/\/www.sysnative.com\/forums\/hardware-tutor... You may need to enter BIOS\/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:https:\/\/www.mydigitallife.net\/comprehensive-lis... Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link.3) Choose Advanced Troubleshoot options to run System Restore, or if this was a version Update choose More Options to Go Back to Old Version.If it rolls back then you can hide the Windows Updates and Version Upgrade responsible until they mature by installing and running immediately the Hide Updates tool:https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/224471\/how-to-prevent... There is a new option after Version 1809 to roll back Windows Updates from the Repair Mode in Option Four here:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/5486-uninst... If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows.4) If that fails you can use the booted media created in Step 2 to Clean Install the latest version which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The link compiles the best possible install of Windows 10 that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given.There is a step to rescue files from the same bootable media: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.The media provided for the Clean Install is latest and normally the problems go away with the Clean Install, however if they don't you can find earlier version media to use here:https:\/\/tb.rg-adguard.net\/public.phpBurn to DVD or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/download\/detail...
