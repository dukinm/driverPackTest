No ideas what is wrong.As we noticed, vendors have already begun to give massive recommendations not to install 1903 (with pictures of how to roll back to the previous Windows version).See example:https:\/\/supportdesk.win911.com\/support\/solutions\/articles\/24000043298-windows-10-version-1903-tapi-incompatibilityIt is clear that this is the wrong way.The only right way, the problem should be fixed on Microsoft side, and the faster the better.Can you please fix?Thanks in advance.","Thank you,,,Hopefully this will be fixed soon!!!!","The problem is somewhere with winmm,dllwaveOut\u2026waveIn\u2026waveOutGetNumDevs\/waveInGetNumDevs do not contain \"modem\" voice devices in the enumeration (like before), do not see!!!https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/win32\/api\/mmeapi\/nf-mmeapi-waveoutgetnumdevsso waveOutOpen\/waveInOpen (that TAPI app need) or any other will not work.The replacement of winmm,dll etc. does not helpMay be something wrong with registry, may be something corrupted in Windows audio subsystems.No further ideas.","Well, here is the manual fix and will work.[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]\"waveN\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]\"waveN\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Userinstallable.drivers] \/\/???\"waveN\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\000X\\Drivers\\wave\\serwvdrv.dll]\"Driver\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"\"Description\"=\"Modem Wave Driver\"\"Alias\"=\"waveN\"For example, you have installed 2 voice modems.1) [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]Find the last wave[N-1], say \"wave1\" exists and create 2 entries:\"wave2\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"\"wave3\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"2) [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]Add the same as in (1)\"wave2\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"\"wave3\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"3) Find your \"unimodem\"\u00a0devices\u00a0at this path:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\ and add aliaces you have already added:[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0003\\Drivers\\wave\\serwvdrv.dll]\"Alias\"=\"wave2\"[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Class\\{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}\\0004\\Drivers\\wave\\serwvdrv.dll]\"Alias\"=\"wave3\"4) Restart the computer.

Necessary to replace consistently and test. But the bottom line is that they must be replaced at the time of installation of the modem driver, and not when modem is already installed.And naturally, Microsoft is simply obliged to deal with this, because writing such \"fixes\" on the vendor's side is at least a bad idea.Thanks.","Well, even easier, you need to add 1 entry into registry (and its 32-bit copy on x64).1) Goto [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]Find the last wave\u2026 parameter, say \"wave\" and\u00a0\"wave1\" are exist and create\u00a01 new\u00a0entry wave(+1):\"wave2\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"2) Goto [HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\WOW6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Drivers32]Add the same as in (1)\"wave2\"=\"serwvdrv.dll\"3) Restart the computer.The already installed modems will work.

Whenever I plug in an external hard drive (Seagate Backup Plus NAB90MJS 2019) the computer goes into black screen. Things I have tried:1. Using Legacy BIOS2. Disabling USB Devices in BIOS3. Lowering the priority for USB connected devices during boot up.4. Installed WDS SES Driver (I know mine is a seagate but per another website that solved their problem with a WD external hdd)5. Tried both front USB 2.0 ports and the USB 3.0 ports in the back of the alienwhere alpha.6. Changed \"USB setting\" and disabled the \"USB Selective Suspend Setting\".\u00a0 Mine did not have battery bc it's not a laptop.\u00a0 For those who want to try it it's windows+R, type in powercfg.cpl, Change Plan Setting, Change Advance power setting, look for \"USB Setting\" and then turn off.\u00a0 If on laptop you will do that for \"on battery\" and \"plugged in setting.\"The external HDD is fine when I plug it in.\u00a0 If I leave it there however the computer will not boot up and locked in the black screen. It seems to be booting up from the external drive via USB port. The alienware logo doesn't even boot up it's just a black screen.\u00a0 If I use Legacy BIOS, it recognizes my SSD drive but unable to boot devices.\u00a0 I have to be in UEFI mode to boot up properly so it's back to standard SECURED BOOT UP mode. I believe this is a Windows 10-specific issue with USB device drivers rather than an alienware alpha or external HDD issue.I have another PC for which a similar issue arises when I plug in my external Blu-ray driver and it will not boot-up Windows 10 unless I unplug the external blu-ray driver from the front USB 2.0 port as it appears to be attempting to boot up from the external blu-ray drive.So I want to pose the generic question: I am unable to boot windows 10 with external drives attached. Anyone with any ideas?","solutions":["Hello JohnLi3, thank you for providing this question. I am a seasoned Windows expert with almost a decade in usage and support experience and hope to resolve your problems quickly.It has nothing to do with WIndows 10 as the boot fails prior to Windows being ever loaded.It might just be that the external drive is not properly configured for uefi secure boot.Windows 10 doesn't like being started in legacy BIOS when being used to UEFI secure boot. So:1. In UEFI your external hdd breaks boot sequence. 2. In legacy BIOS Windows 10 doesn't start because internal hard drive is GPT formatted.See also: docs.microsoft.com\/windows-hardware\/manufacture\/desktop\/boot-to-uefi-mode-or-legacy-bios-modeYou could format C: and reinstall Windows to use MBR instead of GPT, turn of secure boot beforehand and set the proper boot order from then on this would mean using BIOS and not UEFI altogether. Quite some work compared to just unplugging the external hdd on boot. Or try to buy another hdd which properly supports UEFI boot. If you consider your problem solved it would be very good if you marked the answer which helped you so others can find and use this thread.If this didn't solve your problem or you need further assistance please answer in this thread and i would be happy to help.kind regards F.
