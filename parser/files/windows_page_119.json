If i do the same from another subnet i am asked to provide user\/pass, which i can't because there isn't any.

Originally for the first week it worked great and everything ran perfectly as it should. Then I downloaded the origin installer and downloaded Apex legends to play with a few friends. But every time I would play the game it would crash about half way through or after the first few minutes (about 5-8). Originally it only effected Apex, but then the next day I went to play Call of Duty Modern Warfare and then that started crashing, but again all of my other games worked fine, those include Dead by Daylight, Warframe, Terraria and a few others. So I tried deleting and reinstalling both games and that didn't work after trying it twice, then I went as far as even doing a full fresh install of windows 10. Now it has progressed and Warframe no longer works and every time I try to play any of those games listed that previously crashed for more then about 10- 20 minutes the computer fully crashes and has to reboot showing a system error Unexpected Store Exception. I'm currently running Windows 10 with the 1909 update and have a laptop with 32 gb of RAM a 2080 Max-Q and a i7-9750H so hardware not being able to handle the games or system is not the problem.Any help is appreciated, Thanks!!","solutions":["Hi SK. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Keep in mind you have a one year support, repair and replacement warranty that comes with the PC so if problems persist you can call on them to fix or replace it, making sure it gets done soon enough so you can ensure the repairs or replacement work in time for the warranty expiration, or extend it. You might also still be under Store return policy.If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in 1) Safe Mode with Networking (so you have internet) or 2) Safe Mode accessed by one of the illustrated steps in this guide:https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/4-ways-boot-saf.... You will need to use your password to get into Safe Mode as a PIN is not accepted.1) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) Compare the install you did with this gold standard Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The reason I ask you to do this is because no one of millions who have followed the install in that link has ever come back to report problems that I have seen. It is also a great learning experience that will make you permanently the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and have applied it with your own hands. 4) Test the RAM overnight to stress it with the best bootable test memtest86, following this guide to test both sticks and slots:https:\/\/www.wikihow.com\/Test-PC-RAM-with-MemTest86Run Crucial System Scanner to check the RAM is properly spec'd and configured: https:\/\/www.crucial.com\/usa\/en\/systemscanner?cm... 5) Test the hard drive or SSD with diagnostics: https:\/\/www.lifewire.com\/free-hard-drive-testin...https:\/\/mashtips.com\/ssd-health-test-and-perfor...HP and Dell have hardware diagnostics triggered by tapping the ESC or F12 keys respectively as you power on.Best is to use the HDD\/SSD manufacturer's own if there is one, otherwise use Seatools bootable long test:http:\/\/blog.nowherelan.com\/2013\/04\/04\/boot-seat...
