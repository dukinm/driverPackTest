The workaround is to enable the option \"Hide mouse at screen edge\" on the Settings form\u00a0or switch the focus to another window first.In Windows 8 & up, the mouse pointer might be invisible if there is no physical mouse attached to the machine. Plug in an unused\u00a0mouse or turn on Mouse Keys in Control Panel.Some users mentioned having the KeysNotMatched error when reinstalling the app in one machine even typing in the same key. Restarting the app in both machines would help.Tips, tricks and FAQsWhy there is no longer an option to bind to a specific networkIn the latest version released about a year ago, the option to bind to a specific network is removed. Instead, the app connects using the right network automatically. The concept of network interface\/adapter is too advanced to a normal user, so we keep changing to give the best experience as possible where an user would not have to do so many configurations.Advanced users who still want to block the app via a specific network can still do so by blocking the app in Windows firewall on a specific network, see the last note in \"Firewall Settings for Mouse Without Borders\" below.Lock\/Unlock all machines at onceHit\u00a0Ctrl+Alt+L twice to lock all machines. NOTE: If you use a Polish keyboard, Alt+L (to show up the'\u0142' letter) would be eaten up in the remote machine so you would better change this hotkey to something else:)To unlock all machines, first switch to multiple mode (default hotkey is hitting Ctrl 3 times fast) then keyboard will repeat in all machines.Ctrl+Alt+Del in the remote machineThis is supported in\u00a0Windows 7 and newer versions of Windows. Please follow these steps in every machine, this needs to be done once per machine:\u00a01. Enable SAS to allow the Services: a. Run gpedit.msc (Edit group policy) b. Go to Computer Configuration > Administrative Templates > Windows Components > Windows Logon Options > Disable or enable software Secure Attention Sequence, select Services in the Dropdown box.From now on you can use Ctrl+Alt+End is to simulate the CAD in the slave machine.Full-screen app\/game: losing focus when switching machineIf you experience this issue. unchecking the option \"Hide mouse at screen edge\"\u00a0would help.Keyboard does not work in the remote machine when using full-screen Remote Desktop client in the controller machineSome full-screen apps would eat all key strokes so the option \"Hide mouse at screen edge\"\u00a0mentioned above\u00a0should be checked to work around this scenario.Mouse LagIf you use the app with a wireless connection in a busy network, you may experience mouse lag. A wired connection is recommended.Mouse move speed in remote machine\u00a0is faster or different between vertical and horizontal directionsThis may caused by having multiple monitors in the remote machine. Checking the option \"Move mouse relatively\" would help.Mouse button swap is not preserved in the remote machineIn case you change the primary mouse button in Windows Settings, mouse data sent over the network is already reverted. So you should not change the primary button in the remote machine. In case the Settings are sync'd, you may want to turn the \"Syncs your settings\" off in Windows Settings.Disable\/Enable startup with WindowsTo disable the app from automatic startup when Windows starts, run this in the command line window: sc config MouseWithoutBordersSvc start=demand(You can also do that in the Windows Service Manager (services.msc))To enable the app to startup automatically: sc config MouseWithoutBordersSvc start=autoAdd a hotkey to start\/stop the app (enable\/disable app)Windows does support this for any app, you just need to create a desktop shortcut\u00a0to the app (\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBorders.exe\") then you can configure a hotkey for the shortcut :In the shortcut Properties' dialog, go to the Shortcut tabSet focus on the Shortcut key value.Type any key to set a desired hotkey, for ex.: type M to set the hotkey to Ctrl+Alt+MClick OK or Apply.The default hotkey to exit the app is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q and you can change that in the app's Settings.You can now use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Q to exit\/disable the app and Ctrl+Alt+M to start\/enable the app.Firewall Settings for Mouse Without Borders(optional: How to disable the app on a specific network).Mouse without Borders setup automatically adds itself to the Windows Firewall allowed program list. But few users found these steps helpful in some cases to allow and customize the tool through Windows Firewall:1. Click on the Start button then click on Control Panel. 2. Click on Administrative Tools. 3. Click on Windows Firewall with Advanced Security. 4. Select Inbound Rules on the right tree. 5. Click on the New Rule... in the Actions list on the left. 6. Select Program option and click next. 7. Browse to select Mouse without Borders application (%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBorders.exe) and click Next.(In X64 machine the path should be %ProgramFiles(X86)%\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBorders.exe)8. Select Allow the connection and click Next. 9. Select all options for \u201cWhen does this rule apply?\u201d and click Next. 10. Enter the name for the rule and click Finish. 11. The rule should now show up in the list, you can double click on it to view details and make change.12. Restart Mouse without Borders. * If you have multiple network interfaces, wired and wireless, you can also customize to allow the application on the type of interface in step 11 above \u2013 In Advanced tab, click on Customize. Mostly you would always want to allow the application through the Local area network. You may need to create both Inbound and Outbound rules to block the app on a specific network interface (wireless for example).Skip .Net check when installing the app (or manually install the app)The installer checks your system to make sure you have a required .Net version 4\u00a0before installing. Few users have reported that the installation is blocked even the .Net version is already installed. Some registry key is probably corrupted in this case, to work around this you can run the installer without UI option: msiexec \/i MouseWithoutBordersSetup.msi \/qnYou can also manually install the app using these steps:Create a folder C:\\MM \u00a0Download the file MouseWithoutBordersSetup.msi to that folder. \u00a0In an elevated cmd windows (run as Admin), run the following commands:\u00a0msiexec \/a \"C:\\MM\\MouseWithoutBordersSetup.msi\" \/qb TARGETDIR=\"C:\\MM\\Bin\" \/l*v \"C:\\MM\\Install.Log\"\u00a0sc create MouseWithoutBordersSvc binPath= \"C:\\MM\\Bin\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBordersSvc.exe\" start= auto DisplayName= \"Mouse Without Borders Service\"\u00a0Manually add the program (C:\\MM\\Bin\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBorders.exe) to the firewall exception list (allow it through firewall).\u00a0You can now create a desktop shortcut to \"C:\\MM\\Bin\\Microsoft Garage\\Mouse without Borders\\MouseWithoutBorders.exe\"Troubleshooting\u00a0share clipboard issue(Applicable to version 2.1.7.1212 and up)A good number of users have reported that clipboard sharing may stop at a time and they would need to do\u00a0something to bring it back like restarting the app, reconnect (Ctrl+Alt+R), click Apply on the Settings form. Just in case you want to find out why it stops working in your environment, here is how it works and how to look at the local log:Clipboard monitoring is done by the helper process MouseWithoutBordersHelper.exe so you want to make sure this process is running and MouseWithoutBorders can talk to it (the mini log should has a line likeHelper:<APositiveNumber>, and a full log should have this line: Trace: Clipboard monitor method AddClipboardFormatListener is used.)When a text is copied, there should be a blinking blue dot on the app system tray icon:\u00a0and looking at the full\u00a0log you\u00a0can find\u00a0something like[258] = 12\/19 15:43:17.236(15)FROM HELPER: GetClipboardText:TXT = 79, RTF = 0, HTM = 0.[259] = 12\/19 15:43:17.236(15)CheckClipboardEx: ShareClipboard = True, data = String.[262] = 12\/19 15:43:17.236(15)Plain\/Zip = 240\/153[263] = 12\/19 15:43:17.236(15)SetToggleIcon: 2which tells that a text was placed into the system\u00a0clipboard at 15:43:17 and the app's ShareClipboard option is On. (Btw you can get the full log by click on Generate log in the app's system tray context menu).The text is then sent to other machines and you would also see a blue blinking dot like above in other machines\u00a0telling that they got the text. You would see some lines like this in the full log of the app running in other machines:[4007] = 12\/19 15:43:17.296(43)0.08KB of TXT <-[4008] = 12\/19 15:43:17.296(72)0.08KB of TXT <-[4009] = 12\/19 15:43:17.296(43)SetToggleIcon: 2The app uses the\u00a0Clipboard.GetText\u00a0and similar APIs\u00a0to access the system clipboard which may\u00a0also be used by other apps running in your machines. If multiple apps access the clipboard concurrently\u00a0it may\u00a0cause an error,\u00a0we work around that by\u00a0retrying for a few times. If a large image is\u00a0in the\u00a0clipboard, retrying may not help in a slow machine and you would see\u00a0this line in the full log:\u00a0Requested Clipboard operation did not succeed.Change the TCP port that the app listens onMouse Without Borders listens on ports 15100 and 15101 by default. If you get an error on port conflict. There is probably another app running in the machine using the same ports. To see which program is using those same ports, you can run these commands in the cmd window:netstat -nao | find \"15100\"netstat -nao | find \"15101\"The last column of the console output from the commands above are the process ids, you can then look up for the process name from Task Manager.To avoid the port conflict, you can either configure the other app or Mouse Without Borders to use different ports.To configure Mouse Without Borders to listen on different ports (for ex. port 12345), follow these steps in all machines:Download psexec and save it locally -https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/sysinternals\/downloads\/psexecRun the following command in an Admin\/elevated cmd window: psexec -i -s\u00a0reg add HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\MouseWithoutBorders \/v TcpPort \/t REG_DWORD \/d12345 \/fRestart Mouse Without BordersPersonalize logon screen using local pictures1. Create one folder named MouseWithoutBorders under \\Windows\\Web\\ directory. 2. Drop your photos there (jpg only). 3. In a cmd windows, run del \"%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Low\\MM.Local.Indexer.txt\" then restart Mouse without Borders.Customize your keyboard layoutYou may want to play around with your keyboard layout by mapping a virtual key to another one, you can come up with a new layout you would invent:) This feature is for advanced users only.For example, if you want to convert your QWERTY keyboard to a DVORAK keyboard then these are steps:\u00a0Run the following commands as Admin to set the virtual key mappings (you can also use Regedit to do this):\u00a0reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MouseWithoutBorders \/v VKFrom \/t REG_SZ \/d \"081,087,069,082,084,089,085,073,079,080,0219,0221,083,068,070,071,072,074,075,076,186,222,090,088,067,086,066,078,188,190,191,189,187\" \/f\u00a0reg add HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\MouseWithoutBorders \/v VKTo \/t REG_SZ \/d \"222,188,190,080,089,070,071,067,082,076,191,187,079,069,085,073,068,072,084,078,083,189,186,081,074,075,088,066,087,086,090,219,221\" \/f\u00a0In the Settings form, check the option Use Key Mappings then you are good to go (default hotkey to toggle this option is Ctrl+Alt+Shift+K).This is just an example. FYI, Windows does support Dvorak layout, the difference here is that this app skips the mapping when Ctrl key is down so Ctrl+[X,C,V] work as original layout.Discussions\/Posts\u00a0in other languages\u30de\u30a6\u30b9 \/ \u30ad\u30fc\u30dc\u30fc\u30c9 \u3092\u3001\u8907\u6570\u306e\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u9593\u3067\u5171\u6709\u3059\u308b!Mouse without Borders: Vier PCs, eine MausUtilize v\u00e1rios computadores com apenas um mouse e um teclado!Mouse Without Borders : une souris pour plusieurs PC\u8b93\u6ed1\u9f20\u7834\u300c\u7a97\u300d\u800c\u51fa\u7684\u514d\u8cbb Microsoft KVM \u7a0b\u5f0fUn mouse una tastiera per 4 PC: ordine sulla scrivaniaMouse without Borders \u2013 \u0443\u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u043c \u0447\u0435\u0442\u044b\u0440\u044c\u043c\u044f \u041f\u041a \u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c\u044e \u0438 \u043a\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u043e\u0439Microsoft \ubcf5\uc218\uc758 PC\uc758 \ub9c8\uc6b0\uc2a4, \ud0a4\ubcf4\ub4dc\ub97c LAN\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uc720\uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 Mouse without Borders \uacf5\uac1cMouse Without Borders, kendalikan banyak komputer dengan satu mouse\u0110i\u1ec1u khi\u1ec3n nhi\u1ec1u m\u00e1y t\u00ednh v\u1edbi 1 chu\u1ed9t 1 b\u00e0n ph\u00edmUsers love Mouse Without BordersAs you are\u00a0reading this far, you probably have good reasons to try out the app ^.^!

The beta version was created in probably a week with total of 34 downloads.According to statistics, the app has been downloaded by all 193 countries millions times. North Korea did make\u00a0one completed download - guess who?:)Japanese likes to share information about the app as many\u00a0posts on Twitter\u00a0are in Japanese.Few users recognize that the app symbol (icon) does look like a mouse:) - Quite a few\u00a0users do not know that keyboard works with the app too:) that keyboard does follow mouse to the remote machine.
