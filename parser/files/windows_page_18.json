I could not understand why as this is a brand new home built Ryzen 9 PC with 32 gb ram etc. This obviously had me worried.Then some days after it crashed again (after midnight UK time), each crash was at the same time of night and I also noted that the windows updater \"loading icon\" was visible on start up which lead to me wonder if Windows updates were causing the crashes.I checked the Windows update settings and the update time period was set to the time frame I was online and gaming when the crashes occurred. I then changed this to a more preferable time. On checking the update history I could see that Windows definition updates were done at the time of the crashes.Tonight I had the same crash with the same \"loading icon at bootup\" and low and behold, windows had updated the definitions at the time of the crash!Windows updates, more specifically the definition updates which are \"silent updates\" are crashing my computer so is Microsoft aware of this and looking into it ?

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I'll give you everything possible for fixing failed Windows Updates, so that at least something will work before you work through them all. Even if you've tried a step, please do it over in sequence:Some Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see. If not or they are bothering you then here are steps you can take:1) Run the Windows Update Troubleshooter from Windows Settings > Update & Security > Troubleshoot.2) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/10164\/....

Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 7) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open installed Tool and choose to Upgrade the PC Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version 1909. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... _____________________ Good news!

Is there an actual way to this and if I try to move the \"Pictures\" folder now will it move all my files on that drive?I'm just concerned that all the files on my new drive is now associated with that folder and that moving it would case all the files on the new harddrive to also move in turn.Thanks for any help given!","solutions":["As long as you're restoring the Pictures folder to default location as shown here then you can approve that, no problem:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/23504-resto...","You are correct that you would move to E:\\Pictures after creating that folder there.Yes, you can use the folder you already created named Pictures on E."]},{"symptom":"windows vista will display the website that i want but will not allow me to enter and        My older laptop is on windows vista and I can enter the website that I want.\u00a0 It will display but will not allow me in and I did remove google chrome but will still not let me in.\u00a0 Any ideas now what","solutions":["Hi R.A.hu:Chrome has not been supported on Win XP and Vista operating systems since Chrome v49 was released in April 2016 (see Google's blog post athttps:\/\/chrome.googleblog.com\/2015\/11\/updates-to-chrome-platform-support.html).Are you currently using Internet Explorer 9 as your browser, and when you launch IE9 and go to Help | About Internet Explorer does it show that you have Update Versions9.0.60 \/ KB4014661 (Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 9: April 11, 2017) as shown below?I'd recommend you install Mozilla's Firefox ESR v52.9.0 (the legacy version forWin XP and Vista, where ESR = Extended Support Release) and then see if you can access your problem website with this browser.\u00a0 If you browse tohttps:\/\/www.mozilla.org\/en-US\/firefox\/new\/ from your Vista machine it should auto-detect your operating system and offer you the correct 32-bit ESR v52.9.0 installer for your region.

My computer is an HP Spectre X360 laptop, 2017 model I believe, and the touchpad is a Synaptics HID TouchPad. Last night, I tried to turn my touchpad off (didn't need it, since I have a Bluetooth mouse), and neither the normal on\/off switch nor the \"enable touchpad while a mouse is connected\" checkbox worked - the touchpad refused to turn off. I ignored it for a little while, then shut down my computer for the night. This morning, I turned my computer back on to discover that the vast majority of the touchpad settings in the normal Windows settings menu are completely missing, leaving only a dropdown box for changing the touchpad sensitivity.Having been unable to find any solutions on Google, I asked a Microsoft agent for help; they directed me to try and download\/install the latest version of the appropriate touchpad driver for my machine from the HP website. Turns out the driver I was using was the latest version (Synaptics TouchPad Driver (Windows 10 v1809\/v1903)) - the reinstall did nothing, even after another reboot. I also asked my mom, since she works in IT; she informed me that the Mouse Properties dialog box will have touchpad driver settings on some computers, but it doesn't on mine. I searched Synaptics in the Windows Search box at the bottom left, following advice from another Google search for what to do, and the first hit was a dialog box called Synaptics Pointing Device, which seems to have all of the missing settings, albeit in a very different interface. I'm not sure if that existed before last night or not, since I never had a reason to go looking for it.So the touchpad settings seem to have suddenly migrated, without my doing anything or asking them to. I'm still somewhat annoyed, since I just had to waste two hours of an otherwise busy day on this and the Synaptics Pointing Device dialog won't let me pin it to the Start menu, which was where I had the touchpad settings menu pinned for easy access (I like to be able to switch back and forth quickly between mouse\/disabled touchpad for gaming and no mouse\/enabled touchpad for bringing my laptop to class). I can pin this dialog to the taskbar for an effective workaround, but it's easier to misclick things on the taskbar so I prefer to keep as few things there as possible.Any idea how this could have happened, and\/or how to put the touchpad settings back where they belong?","solutions":["Go Settings, Devices, Mouse, Additional mouse options, Touchpad.","That's just the problem: there isn't a separate Touchpad tab under Mouse Properties (the dialog that came up from the \"Additional mouse options\" link, which I have been in and out of throughout this whole process), or at least there isn't on my machine.","Hi Gwyn. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.The surest way to fix a touchpad is to first assure you have the very latest touchpad driver from the HP download page here for your exact Serial and Product number:http:\/\/support.hp.com\/us-en\/drivers. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is how to keep the latest manufacturer's drivers current. Windows Update drivers are never enough.While doing this also Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, go to Mice > Touchpad and then Driver tab. Choose Update Driver, then Automatic to see if it gets a better driver that resolves the problem. If not try Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick to try all previously installed drivers. If that doesn't work then try uninstalling driver, Restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.See the troubleshooting steps here: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402786... Go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad to go over the Settings. Then choose Additional Settings which opens the Mouse properties box. The Touchpad software installs a tab onto it - usually the last one - that should have more settings to check, including a checkbox to Disable Touchpad when USB pointing device is attached. This prevents palm drag from causing the cursor to jumpIf this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately check for these again and hide with the Hide Updates tool explained here: https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta...You can also go into Repair Mode by whichever method works here: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2294-advanc... to use the new Uninstall Updates button in Advanced Troubleshoot Options:https:\/\/pureinfotech.com\/uninstall-updates-adva....
