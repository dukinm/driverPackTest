I have a dual band USB adapter in my PC which allows me to connect to WiFi. After having Fios for 2 weeks, I have noticed that I am getting consistent Ping spikes when playing games or even browsing the web and a webpage takes a while to load. This shouldn't happen as my speed is 370Mbps \/ 350Mbps.I first realized about this issue when I was playing games like Battlefield 5, Rainbow Six, CSGO, Star Wars Battlefront 2. These spikes would make these games completely unplayable.I even tried pinging google on command prompt and I notice the ping spikes.Some things to note:1) On the latest version of Windows 102) This issue only occurs on my desktopI have tried a numerous of things that I have read upon on the forums:1) Updated network drivers2) Turning on and off Airplane mode and Wifi3) Reinstalling network drivers after uninstalling them4) Disabling IpV6 on my network connection5) Running\u00a0netsh wlan set autoconfig enabled=yes interface=\"Wi-Fi 2\" in cmd prompt6) Factory resetting my PC and installing Windows. *** This actually fixed the issue but the issue returned 2 days later ***7) Restarting my routerI have honestly no idea no what else to do. I would appreciate any replies and thank you for your time.","solutions":["Hi ander9991,to try to isolate the problem, if you can, connect to the router temporarily via network cable, then check if the ping improves.Another test you can do is to force the router to work on the 2.4 GHz band, keeping the 5 GHz one disabled and check if the ping improves, or perform the reverse test.Are the router and PC located on the same floor as the house?Are the 2 devices positioned close to or very distant?","When connecting an Ethernet cable, a brand new problem arises. At first it says Unidentified Network - No internet access. I have done some googling and I manually changed the IP address of my PC and it seemed to recognize the network as I was able to see the network name. However there was still no internet access. I then tried to change the DNS servers to some values suggested such as 8.8.8.8 and 1.1.1.1 and it seemed to work. However, I am unable to do anything after that. For instance, If I try going on google it'll just say connecting... and will never connect.The problem still persists on both bands. My PC is approximately 10-15 feet away from the router and on the same floor.","But on the wireless network card did you set DNS and static ip address?If yes, set the same IP addresses on the LAN card, then temporarily disable the wireless network card and repeat the test by connecting via network cable.","No it obtained it manually (wirelessly). On the wired end, I have to manually assign an IP address because it kept saying unidentified network. Then I manually assigned the DNS server of 8.8.8.8 and it seemed to work but I was never able to connect to any webpage.","The PC must be able to work even when connected via a network cable. Is the connection via ethernet direct, from the PC to the router or do you use a hub \/ switch?This test, if I could do it would be very indicative to understand if the problem is caused by the wireless network card or by some application or program that interferes with the wi-fi.Try to disconnect the network cable from both sides, turn off the router and turn it on again after a few minutes, reconnect the network cable and try again. Eventually try to change the LAN port on the router.","Maybe there is a\u00a0discrepancy in my configuration. I will post a picture below.The problem is the PC all the way in the right.So the configuration starts from the Fios box which sends an RJ45 cable to the Fios router (input). The router then outputs 2 CAT5 cables to the TV and the TV box, and also a CAT6 to my office. The CAT6 cable then is connected to an RJ45 outlet which then transmits a CAT5 to a splice. The splice then sends a CAT5 cable to my room where the PC is located through an outlet where another CAT5 cable goes directly into the ethernet port on my motherboard.\u00a0This configuration seems to work if I were to try to connect a laptop where my PC is.","Hi ander9991,thank you for the picture you sent, it's very intuitive.The CAT 5 network cable you are using is not performing, you should use CAT 5e or CAT 6 network cables but all the cables you use should be of the same category.Reconnect to wi-fi and then run and maintain a Clean Boot, then re-run the ping command and verify.https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/929135\/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows","Hi,So just now I took the time and took my PC into my living room (where my router is) and connected it directly via CAT5 and the PC connected right away. Furthermore, I am also not having problems wireless as I am a foot away from the router. However, this PC belongs in another room and there I am having the problems still described. I will attempt to do the Clean Boot as you have stated and will look into the network configuration in my house as that seems to be the issue.\u00a0","Hi ander9991,if now the situation is the one you have just described, I would say that it is no longer necessary to perform a Clean Windows Start because the problem only concerns the wi-fi and that is the distance between the wi-fi router and the location where you usually use the PC .Probably your PC receives a weak or disturbed wi-fi signal when it is far from the wi-fi router, you must try to correct this anomaly.Try moving the wi-fi router slightly or repositioning the antennas, or try temporarily using only the 2.4 GHz network, disabling the 5 GHz one or vice versa."]},{"symptom":"MOBO Upgrade, Cloned SSD, Windows 10 Pro will not activate again.
