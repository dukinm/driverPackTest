In the UK a Windows 10 Home licence is \u00a3119.99 so with an exchange rate your licence should have cost you around the same amount. If not it may not be legal licence and that is one reason it won't activate.How are you trying to upgrade from Windows 8.1 (it must be 8.1) to Windows 10. The best way is to download the ISO image from Microsoft using the Media Creation Tool, select to upgrade another PC and then ISO, save the ISO file on the PC hard drive. When the ISO is downloaded and saved go to the file using Windows Explorer and Mount the drive, this will open a new drive letter. Go to the new drive letter and run setup.When asked for a licence key if you can select skip or do this later or I'm re-installing windows. Wait until you have successfully upgraded to Windows 10.
