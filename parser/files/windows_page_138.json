This seems unlike other black screen errors I've seen.When this occurs, the whole screen goes black, but everything continues to work just fine. In fact, I can move my mouse around on screen (and still see it) just fine - including when it transitions to other states (such as when I hover over buttons or other things that would normally be displayed.) I can also still normally engage in any activities with Windows with no apparent negative impact (outside not seeing what I'm doing.)Additionally, I can access and view the start menu by pressing the \"Windows\" key. However, the moment I attempt to launch or do anything from the start menu it disappears again. It is only visible when it has focus. All applications and attempts (including forcing a driver restart) fail to affect results. This includes launching software and applications that engage full-screen use of the monitor. They fail to initialize screen, but still function as if they had (I can see them working via ALT+TAB). Speaking of which...I can also see what's on my desktop if I ALT+TAB; while ALT+TAB has focus it permits me to view the windows and general environment just fine - but the moment I select a window or otherwise attempt to re-engage my desktop the screen returns to black. CTRL+ALT+DEL also properly functions, and the interrupt menu shows up just fine - but again when I select an option that returns to the Windows environment the screen becomes black once more.The best way I can describe it would be if I were to have a video of absolutely nothing (just black), and I put that full screen. Everything is still functioning behind the video, but I simply can't see it and have no way of determining what I'm doing - I'm literally feeling around in the dark.Does anyone have any suggestions for remedy? This is extremely problematic and several times now has resulted in the loss of an extensive amount of work because I have to log off and back on to correct it.","solutions":["Hi, SupaShaD My name is Jeffrey and I am an Independent Advisor. I would be happy to help you today.First of all, check that the Video driver is installed or updated. https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/402844...","To preempt these concerns in the future:I consider myself to be technically adept. That doesn't mean I'm error free here, rather that technical explanations are understandable to me and it's relatively safe to presume I've conducted \"routine\" troubleshooting.To that point:Video drivers are updated.Device manager indicates no issues with video hardware.Event logs give no indication as to the cause of the screen (there is a warning related to the Oculus Library Video driver but it doesn't correlate to the times of issue and this issue persists when the Oculus is disconnected. I don't think it's causal.)I don't believe it's related to drivers specifically because it's not predicated on any specific conditions. Instead, it happens randomly and only affects the Windows desktop environment and applications. It still properly displays the start menu (when I press the Windows key,) as well as the interrupt menu (CTRL+ALT+DEL). A driver issue to me would present globally, and preclude these specific parts that still function. Furthermore, forcing a driver restart (WIN+CTRL+SHIFT+B) fails to reinitialize (although the command runs successfully.) A logoff and back on, however, will resolve the matter. This further indicates to me that this is a Windows related issue and maybe not specifically related to the video drivers.","Hi SupaShaD, With this particular issue, it is possibly caused by one or more of the following factors:1.

Your feedback is much appreciated. Thanks and regards,","Richard,DISM Scan\/Restore won't function because there is no corruption - I hadn't run it because it's not indicated here. However, I did just attempt it in the spirit of \"trying everything\" and was told as much:\"Deployment Image Servicing and Management toolVersion: 10.0.18362.1Image Version: 10.0.18363.535No component store corruption detected.The operation completed successfully.\"On the software side, yes I have recently uninstalled and reinstalled my drivers. I fairly well dislike nVidia's garbage packaging system for their drivers (which are generally excellent.) Every now and then I will uninstall them and do a fresh install to make sure no vestiges of nVidia's \"Experience\" nonsense (as well as several other unnecessary drivers) hang around.Aye, those reports are from the technical details of the error - and as ambiguous as they've always been, unfortunately. They don't get more helpful than that raw text.I initially thought the issue was predicated by some YouTube video initialization hook failing. I don't think that's the case anymore, as this last event occurred on a raw desktop with no running video or anything else.I will say that it is sometimes preceded by a brief freeze - which I suspect is related to Windows improperly handling the onboard Bluetooth. I suspect that the odd crash this causes (which may be one of the two reports I had pasted previously) may somehow force a state change on the display. But I can't derive how; outside Windows panicking when the kernel goes unresponsive for the five or so seconds the intermittent freezes take. Although it's not what I am here for (originally) I'll take the time to describe this issue in case it serves to be useful in diagnosing (and if you happen to know how to fix it, I'm all ears):Windows will occasionally freeze on me. A full stop, lack of all input, that halts my activity for approximately 5-10 seconds (including Bluetooth signals.) I have no indicators as to why it might happen, or when another will occur. There is no pattern to it. Uniquely, it freezes my computer in its current state, meaning that if I were typing - for instance - and happened to be pressing \"space\" when it freezes, it'll resume having placed about a billion spaces in whatever text box I was typing in (or whatever other character.) Stopping it from spamming the character is a simple matter of pressing the key once. No activity is present on the computer while it's frozen, audio output stops, etc. It's like an extended stutter. This issue does not always lead to the black screen I've mentioned here - but I suspect it has triggered it before - since the black screen issue occasionally follows immediately afterward. Under normal circumstances, the freeze lasts for the specified range of time and then operations on the computer resume without issue.There are rare occasions when it appears to cause the black screen issue, but I don't think it's related specifically to the actual freeze. Instead, I think it may be related to how Windows recovers from the freeze. When it does happen, it happens like so:1.) Computer freezes (screen still displays as normal, just frozen.)2.) Computer unfreezes, a second or so later the screen flickers briefly, before cutting out to a black screen (again, though, I'm still able to see and access programs and the start menu while using ALT+TAB or when I put the focus on the start menu via the Windows key.) Under normal conditions, the computer would freeze and resume without issue. The flickering that occurs seems to suggest to me that some process is failing and re-initializing the drivers improperly or something. I was really hoping to avoid another reinstall or repair, as I've had to go through several now with these awful Windows updates - so I'm storing your link for a last resort. I would probably avoid just repairing, as my ancient tech brain abhors repairs. To me it always seems like \"repairing\" Windows causes more issues than just reinstalling the damn thing - and getting Windows 10 to function, despite itself, has been a chore.","Hello SupaShaD, I'm another independent advisor and wanted to check if there was a section with \"Extra information about the problem\" from the events you have captured from Reliability Monitor?

It appears in any audio source, whether that's in Chrome on YouTube\/Soundcloud, in Edge, via local audio\/video files in Groove Music,\u00a0MusicBee, VLC, the native Win 10 movie player, and even in games. I did not have this issue in Windows 8.1.To describe it in short: It appears at random, though fairly often. Sometimes every 10 seconds, sometimes every 30 - 60 seconds. It is a very short, micro stutter-like glitch in audio. Imagine the moment\u00a0before a BSOD where audio buzzes and glitches out, but for a split second. I think video stutters as well while the audio does, which is most noticeable in games. (Though I may just be thinking that because I expect the video to stutter since the audio stutters as well. But I am fairly certain video does too).The problem persists whether I use my laptop's speakers, headphones, or external speakers.I tried many things, so I would appreciate it if you don't tell me to do those same ones again:I uninstalled and re-installed the latest Nvidia drivers, the latest Intel drivers, the latest Realtek audio drivers. Clean installed all of them by uninstalling specific devices from Device Manager and either installing the latest ones from the manufacturer's website or letting Windows download the best ones it sees fit. None of that worked. Troubleshooting in Windows did nothing either. Increasing and decreasing the default format in the playback device's properties did nothing. I disabled all background programs (all IM's, OneDrive, Antivirus etc)\u00a0that I could to see if they are maybe the problem, nope.I do not see an option to share my dxdiag and msconfig info here, but if someone would want it I can provide it asap.I think this is simply an issue with Windows 10 which will need to be resolved via patch from Microsoft. It is very annoying and I sincerely hope a fix will be out very soon.But either way if anyone knows of a temporary fix or some other things I should do, please do let me know, I would appreciate it greatly!Thank you and kind regards.","solutions":["Hi Ivan,Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.I would like to inform you that as Windows 10 is latest Operating System and it would be needing latest device drivers to work correctly, as the Driver Updates are not available on the manufacturer website I suggest you to install drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.Install the Driver in Compatibility mode:Older drivers can be installed in compatibility mode in Windows 10.

I made him aware of the issue and he is fine with it but hopes Asus\/MS\/Realtek\/whoever else fix the issue soon.
