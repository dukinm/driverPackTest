The KMS server seems to be unavailable and the error code 0x8007232B shows when I tried troubleshooting it. I read about changing it to KMS to MAK but do not fully understand it... note I do not have the product key. Please help.","solutions":["Hi Moin. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.If you're getting a KMS server notification it means it was activated with a volume license used legally only by businesses and other large organizations that activate via an on-site server.This does not mean it never had a legal retail license that consumers use, but you'd have to know the history of the PC to know for sure. One thing to check is if it has an embedded Product Key from factory preinstalled WIndows, almost always Home version. If so and you can confirm the PC only shipped with WIndows 10 it's almost a sure thing you can reinstall Home and it will self-activate. To check this install ProducKey fromhttp:\/\/www.nirsoft.net\/utils\/produkey-x64.zip and look for the OEM-BIOS key only. No other key matters for this. If it has one then google the make and model + specs to see what OS it shipped with. If 10 then there's 90% chance it's Home version key, very few Pro are embedded.Otherwise you can reinstall Home and activate it with a key you buy from Microsoft here:https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/p\/windows-10-ho... I would only buy from MS or a major retailer who back all sales. Any discount keys are normally bogus. You can go ahead and install and wait to buy the key, you'll just not be able to customize it's looks.See here how to do a gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...
