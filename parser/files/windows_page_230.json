Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough.

Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now.

What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues.For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki.... It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy. So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.You can use the latest media because problems which occur during the Version Upgrades almost never repeat during a Clean Install..

This will only remove the UI, not the driver.Go to Device Manager --> Storage controllers --> Intel(R) Chipset SATA\/PCIe RST Premium ControllerDouble-click to open. Go to Driver tab. Click on Update Driver.Click on Browse my computer for driver software.Click on Let me pick from a list of available drivers\u00a0on my computer.Select Intel Chipset SATA RAID Controller and click on Next.Windows 10 will switch to the selected driver and you will have to reboot.You can probably successfully continue using the built-in driver to install any future cumulative updates, but it has no UI to maintain the RAID. If you try reinstalling the 17.7 Intel driver and it fails, retry using the latest version 16 or version 15 drivers with your older chipset.FWIW, I recently upgraded my Intel H87RL motherboard to rid myself of random BSOD's and reboots that I attributed to my Thermaltake power supply. I ended up getting a Gigabyte H370 mb with an i5-9400 CPU, and the RAID chipset works very well with the current Intel drivers and the same power supply. Like you, I tried stringing along the old motherboard by doing a fresh install of Windows 10, but ultimately things went wrong once again. Unfortunately, there's little incentive to keeping the firmware and drivers up-to-date on 6 year old equipment. The\u00a0similar equivalent of X79 is the Z270, Z370, Z390\u00a0or X299 depending on how much you need to tweak your motherboard settings.","I have the same issue\u00a0and I try to find why this happenI try to work on it since 29-12-2019\u00a0each time I downlaod new game on my raid 0 i got a bsod after few second on steam\/battle.net\/twitch...after some test all worked fine for what 30 minute and happen again and again. so I connect my raid in a second PC (still using my mian PC psu)which was not update for almost 6 month , so I test and crash also on it so i thinking is my raid the issue , just still able to read it.

Itcan work, but there may be some data corruption due to the error correction feature of the drive that is designed to record videos with no frame losses.You might want to\u00a0switch to\u00a0a different model WD drive more suited to gaming and Raid like the WD Blue 7200rpm models.If I were trying to solve this BSOD problem, I would find myself a spare hard drive and install a fresh copy of Windows 10 1909 on that hard drive with no other hard drives installed. I would then run Windows Update, and then\u00a0install the RST 17.7 driver, the current video driver, the current version of steam\/battle.net\/ etc., and the 2 raid 0 drives. No other apps or software. See how long you can use this configuration without getting a BSOD.Finally, I would add the rest of the hard drives, but still boot from the spare drive with the fresh copy of Win10 and again see how long you can use this configuration without getting a BSOD.","I have a 850 watt psu , right now i check the voltage line 12 and 5 volt\u00a0The drive is mostly for steam , origin b.net etc.\u00a0Just i got same error without this drive,\u00a0I have a hdd on an another port and same issue and I disconnected the sata on the array and keep the non-raid drive and got sometime bsod other time a slow down to ZeroI do a check with aida64 , this one can read the S.M.A.R.T code of each drive on intel RST and Zero error\u00a0I unknow why just if I put out the raid array drive and put on the floor and connected , actually no issue after a good 30 minute ..... there are stacked one on the other one\u00a0 with only the cady from the caseAlso I don't read the data from the copy box , i check the read\/write with aida64 and taskmgr since the copy box show the read speed only and paste in the cache so the speed is fake on the writing side\u00a0Before the issue happen i runned on windows driver and windows 10 1903\u00a0I update the driver to intel\u00a0 and after, windows 10\u00a0 1909 thihnking that can fix the issue and it's still happen\u00a0I still digging on this issue and see what will happen in few hours maybe playing with a cable to find what is wrong\u00a0Alos i use a corsair crystal series 460x , and the psu is a\u00a0 Corsair CP-9020130-NA TX Series TX850M 850W 80 Plus Gold \u00a0\u00a0"]}]}
