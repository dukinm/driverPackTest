My goose is already pretty much cooked through and through with this so I'm beyond the support stage. All the data was corrupted in this process and recovery software isn't helping, I'm just wondering what went so wrong.Earlier this month I decided to make the jump from Intel to AMD and I only recently put everything together. Windows is BSOD'ing like crazy and after confirming it wasn't my hardware that was the problem, I attempted to look through the software. The blue screens start happening quicker and quicker until I'm simply left pre-login screen with the loading indicator spinning.I jump into the recovery environment and working through CMD I discovery that my EFI partition is gone, that's why bootrec wasn't working. I mull over trying to fix the problem for a day and attempt to fix the EFI partition but CMD isn't giving me any success. Feeling royally screwed, I decided to reinstall windows, I could use a good spring cleaning anyways.After the reinstall, things seem stable so I install all the needed drivers and everything seems fine. A half-hour goes by and I'm setting up the new install when I get a driver power BSOD. I restart, uninstall, and reinstall the drivers figuring that something didn't install correctly. I've had this happen before so I wasn't unfamiliar with the issue. I work for an hour and things seem fine. I go to My Computer and notice that only the NVME I installed Windows on is showing up. Ah, that's right, I unplugged my hard drives before reinstalling Windows so I wouldn't accidentally format them in the install process. I shut down, plug them in, and restart.Disk Management is promptly brought up and all my hard drives are showing up as unallocated. With MiniTool Partition Wizzard, I recover the drives and assign them a letter. Everything is on them and seems fine so I restart the computer again, now everything is not fine again. The blue screens are back, my drives are unallocated again, and after some searching, I find out that it's the storage drivers that are the problem. I uninstall those and reinstall generics in their place and restart.I bring up My Computer again and my drives are missing once more. Disk Management shows the hard drives now as all RAW partitions. I do another partition recovery and while two of the three drives recover successfully, one wasn't so lucky. After attempting a data recovery with both MiniTool and EaseUS, I'm finding names and folders of what used to be on the drive, but the gigabytes of video recordings that used to be present on the drive, are now only megabytes of corrupt data.The same thing would also happen with a backup SSD but that only contained images of my previous Windows installation, no big loss since nothing important was on it.Between the three hard drives, two SSD's, and an NVME drive, I got seven terabytes of storage space for a reason, so stuff like this doesn't happen.

The ones that have had problems so far are these:Conan Exiles, Crash Bandicoot N'Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy and League Of Legends. I am also having problems with the Blizzard Battle.Net application.All games are original, purchased and installed by Valve's Steam app, but even though I do everything possible, I can no longer play them. I've tried several alternatives like reinstalling games, checking file integrity, updating Direct X, upgrading Visual Basic c ++, running with compatibility, upgrading all pc drives, including Nvidia card, back windows and card upgrade Nvidia for the previous version and other things, but the same errors still persist.Before when I installed the pirated version of the same games, downloaded by Torrent, they were running perfectly without any problems, errors, crashes, bugs, lags or delays, I even managed to make some lives for Mixer, but when I tried to reinstall them again to compare the ones. files, they started to give the same problem as the originals. That is, I believe the issue is not the game itself, but something on the computer.I no longer know what to do to fix or what to appeal to. It is only these games that have problems. Others I have installed on the pc are Monster Hunter World, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls Online, Okami HD among others and none of them have any errors or problems to run.These are the specifications of the notebook gamer I use:- Brand: Acer- Model: AN515-51-50U2Operational system:- Windows 10 Home 64-bitCPU and Chipset:- Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 i5-7300HQ- 7th generation - Quad Core- 2.5 GHz - 3.5 GHz with Turbo Boost- 6 MB SmartCache- Intel\u00ae HM175 ChipsetRAM memory:- 8 GB DDR typeVideo card:- NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 1050 with 4 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memoryStorage:- 2.5 \u201dhard drive with 1TB capacity- SATA III (6 GB \/ s) - 5,400 RPMThe Blizzard Battle.Net app doesn't maximize on the screen, although I can run the games I have (World Of Warcraft and Overwatch) by the shortcuts on the pc home screen, but I can no longer access the store or even install new games since the window is not shown.In the case of League Of Legends, the game does not open on the screen, although the taskbar icon appears and the login screen music starts playing. There is only a small white rectangle on the screen and it doesn't help at all.With Crash Bandicoot N'Sane Trilogy not working when the Nvidia card is enabled to process game graphics, it only responds if it is left to run on the Intel HD Graphics card and is unable to support and run the game well, leaving he from 10 up to a maximum of 15 fps, when not locking.Already Conan Exiles and Spyro Reignited Trilogy have the following errors:Conan Exiles:Fatal error:[File: E: \\ B \\ branch_exiles-stable \\ code \\ Engine \\ Source \\ Runtime \\ Windows \\ D3D11RHI \\ Private \\ D3D11RHUntil.cpp] [Line: 232]Result failedat[File: E: \\ B \\ branch_exiles-stable \\ code \\ Engine \\ Source \\ Runtime \\ Windows \\ D3D11RHI \\ Private \\ D3D11Viewport.cpp: 289with error 8876017cSpyro Reignited Trilogy:LowLevelFatalError[File: D: \\ Bamboo \\ buildbot-package \\ Engine \\ Source \\ Runtime \\ Windows \\ D3D11RHI \\ Private \\ D3D11Util.cpp] [Line: 233]Result failedat D: \\ Bamboo \\ buildbot-package \\ Engine \\ Source \\ Runtime \\ Windows \\ D3D11RHI \\ Private \\ D3D11Viewport.cpp: 303with error 8876017C0x0000000030F89129 KERNELBASE.dll!
