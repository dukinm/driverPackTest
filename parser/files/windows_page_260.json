(I think...)I spent hours yesterday trying to find the solution to this problem, trying stuff at random and search the internet for ideas. Nothing worked, but I was reading about one person who said his touch pad was causing his flickering problem. I don't have a touch pad, but I do have a touch monitor. In fact I have two monitors, one touch and one is not, which may or may not having anything to do with it.Anyway, the touch screen monitor was the problem. The first way to solve this, in my situation, was to go to Device Manager > Human Interface Devices > HID-compliant touch screen, right click and disable the device. This worked immediately.However, as I realized later, the far easier solution is to reach around to the back of the monitor and unplug the usb cord that connects the monitor's touch screen functionalities to the computer. This too caused the flickering mouse cursor to stop.\u00a0Very frustrating problem if you don't know the solution. But when you do it is easy.

I had that as well and realized that there was another faint image of the mouse pointer stuck at the top of my other monitor (as if attempting to break through into the monitor where the mouse was behaving crazy). Just \"undocking\" my laptop and \"re-docking\" it immediately resolved the issue. (As FYI, I have my monitor layout set so that my laptop monitor appears 'below' the larger (docked) monitor...as my laptop is usually resting on a fairly low table for ergonomics of typing on the keyboard while seated.)My hunch is that due to some timing issue, the mouse pointer ended up in a split personality mode...may be I was moving it across the monitor boundary just while docking.Anyways, thanks for your keen observation.\u00a0-- Manish"]},{"symptom":"Unable to upgrade to latest version of Windows 10        I have tried repeatedly to upgrade, without success.\u00a0 I keep getting a message about not having enough storage space despite the fact that I have installed a brand new 124GB SD card to help with the temporary storage needs during the upgrade.\u00a0 I have also deleted all unnecessary files, emptied recycle bin, etc.\u00a0 I don't know what else it wants me to do.

So I often use it to make slideshows and small videos.\u00a0 Windows Movie Maker 2012 is more advanced, and it organizes media files in a timeline (similar to many commercial-level editors).

What I done a couple months back was my computer stopped working for a random reason and it didn't start up and kept on popping up with this sad face saying 'the pc ran into a problem'. So I decided to keep restarting it until it opened up the Windows desktop which it did. My Windows 10 update was ready but it skipped a little bit of it and it came up with an error code. I then decided to do a system restore (which was a silly thing for me to do) and now after I did the system restore, the windows update still didn't work. I knew I couldn't do a system restore as you have to wait for a certain amount of time to do it again. So I decided to uninstall an update which made it worse. I also tried to reset my computer completely but after a long wait, it said that it couldn't do it due to an error and it didn't change anything.After a while, I received a feature update for Windows 10 Version 1909, so I decided to update it to that but it came up with a different error code. It also skips a little bit of the update at the start and goes straight to 11%. Once it does that, it then finishes at 21% but doesn't finish the rest of this update due to an error and it also shows up the same error code.It now says 'Your device is missing important security and quality fixes.'It then shows this message below 'There were problems installing some updates, but we'll try again later.'The update I have been trying to install for months is a Windows 10 1903 Cumulative update and the error code is (0x80070057).The update is '2019-12 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1903 for x64-based Systems (KB4530684)'I'm hoping someone can help me as I am able to do intelligence updates for Windows Anti Virus but cannot do Cumulative or Feature updates.Overall I believe I have done something which made my system confused. Apart from that everything on my computer is working fine.So I'm hoping someone could help me with this problem as I have been facing this issue for more than 3 Months now.","solutions":["Hi, My name is Gary an independent advisor and I would be happy to help you out with your concern,Open cmd by searching \"cmd\" on the start menu, make sure to run it as administratorExecute this command on the command prompt DISM \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/RestoreHealth Run these commands on the command prompt to restart windows update services net stop bits net stop cryptsvc net stop wuauserv net stop msiserver Ren C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old Ren C:\\Windows\\System32\\catroot2 Catroot2.old net start bits net start cryptsvc net start wuauserv net start msiserver After successfully executing the commands, I would suggest performing a clean boot to disable third party background services that may be interrupting with the windows update services1.
