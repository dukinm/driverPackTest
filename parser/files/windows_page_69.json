{"windows":[{"symptom":"A look at running older versions of Microsoft Office on Windows 10        Technical Level : Basic SummaryBill Gates once said you could purchase a license for a version of any software from Microsoft and never have to purchase another version. It is the responsibility of the company to make newer releases more enticing by adding further value through improved features and functionality. Microsoft Office has been one of the company's biggest successes. For more than 20 years, the company has released new revisions with unique features that make it an enticing upgrade. At the same time, there are users who fall in love with a revision and never decide to upgrade again, simply because that version is good enough.Since Microsoft announced the launch of Windows 10, a lot of persons are asking, if the license for the version of Microsoft Office they own will work on the new version of Windows. In this article, we'll find out.DetailsUpdate: Microsoft recently updated the requirements for running Microsoft Office on the Windows 10. Starting with Windows 10, version 10 1607 or later, Office 2007 is no longer certified compatible. This does not mean you can't run Office 2007 on Windows 10; as evidenced by the fact that versions as old as Office 95 still work on Windows 10, you should still be able to install and use it. It is possible future updates and revisions to Windows 10 might break the suite or functionality might no longer work. Source: Which versions of Office work with Windows 10? - Microsoft OfficeWhich versions of Microsoft Office are officially\u00a0supported Windows 10?The following versions of Microsoft Office with the latest Service Packs have been confirmed to be compatible with Windows 10:Office 2019 or Office 365 subscriptionsOffice 2016Office 2013Office 2010 (exception Office Starter 2010)Older versions of Office such as Office 2007, Office 2003 and Office XP are not certified compatible with Windows 10 but might work with or without\u00a0compatibility mode.Please be aware that Office Starter 2010 is not supported. You will be prompted to remove it before the upgrade starts.Is Office included for free with Windows 10?No, desktop Office 2016\/Office 365\u00a0or any prior version\u00a0will not be free. Microsoft Office Team has developed a special touch optimized version of Microsoft Office for Tablets running Windows 10. This will be a free limited functionality version gear towards basic editing in Tablet mode. It lacks many of the capabilities of desktop Office. You can download it from the store.UPDATE: The Touch Optimized versions of office Learn more:The next chapter of Office on Windows - Office BlogsWhat about older versions of the suite though, such as Office 2000, Office XP (2002) and Office 2003?Recently I came across an article by noted Windows extraordinaire Paul Thurrott discussing a recent Twitter tease fromGabe Aul (Engineering General Manager for Data and Fundamentals team in Microsoft's Operating Systems Group) showing a vintage version of the suite; Office for Windows 95 running on Windows 10. I thought this was interesting to know that 20 year old software runs just fine on the latest version of Windows. Talk about bringing your investments forward!Word for Windows 95 running on Windows 10 - sourcehereWith a volume of questions on the Windows 10 Reservation forum asking whether their Office 2000, 2003 or XP version is compatible; I decided to do so some test for users who would like to know. So, I went in the garage and looked for those exact copies to try them out on Windows 10. Based on Gabe Aul's screenshot, we can pretty much confirm Office 95 and Office 97 will likely run. If I have the time, I will update this article and give those versions a try at a later date.SetupAll three versions started setup nicely with exception for Office 2000 setup which presented an error message during the install:Error 1904. Module C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files(System\\OLE DB\\MSOLAP.DLL failed to register. HRESULT -2148024714 Contact yoru support support personnel.Running Office setup for 2000, XP and 2003 on Windows 10I promptly clicked Ignore a couple times and setup completed successfully. Later versions such as Office XP and Office 2003 never gave any problems. Please note, I did not make any modifications to setup such as compatibility mode, they all ran and installed without any problem.All three versions installed successfullyTesting Office programsAll apps with the exception of Outlook ran great on Windows 10. I was able to open, create and save documents in all versions of apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Publisher.Outlook was the only problematic app in the suite.Outlook 2000 required using compatibility mode to run properly, it kept crashing each time I launched it. So thats something to keep in mind. Oulook 2002 never gave any problems at all and ran successfully without any modifications. Outlook 2003 was another story, I tried compatibility mode and it seem to make it worse. So, if you depend on Outlook, you should consider upgrading to a later version such as Outlook 2007 or 2013.Office 2000Office XP (2002)Office 2003Publisher versions 2000, 2002 and 2003Publisher 98Installation:You will get the following error regarding the custom dictionary when you launch Publisher 98. Apart from that, it works and functions just fine:There you have it, Publisher 98 running on Windows 10 November Update without issue and no need for compatibility mode:ConclusionThis was not a thorough test, apps like FrontPage or OneNote were not evaluated. Core apps such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Access and Publisher work just fine on Windows 10. By the way, I used Windows 10 64 bit, so users won't have to worry about compatibility issues with this architecture. It remains to be seen if future updates to Windows might break the suite. I will say, I used the RTM versions of each suite. So, I would recommend users of these versions make sure the latest Service Packs, updates and security updates are applied. Keep in mind, Microsoft no longer supports these older versions of the suite, so you weigh the risk of running such versions. Apart from the Office Assistant displaying a rose pink box; there should be no problems running older versions of Office on Windows 10.

Close the Peer to Peer Update Process on Your PC to Fix Slow Internet after Windows 10 UpdateShut down the peer to peer update process on your PC. That is to say, you need to close the channel which you can download applications and system updates from other PC\u2019s connected to the server since it limits your internet bandwidth seeding to other users.Step 1. Click Start menu and then type Settings to open it. Step 2. Select \u201cUpdate and Security\u201c. Step 3. Click the \u201cAdvanced Options\u201d tab. Step 4. Click the option \u201cChoose How Updates are Delivered\". Step 5. Turn off the On button. 2. Adjust the Internet Bandwidth Settings Since windows 10, by default, reserves 20% of the internet bandwidth for the system applications and its operating system, you can\u2019t browse or surf on the internet with 100% internet connection. This solution speeds up the dropping internet speed by trimming down the bandwidth which is reserved for Windows 10 and system applications. Follow the step-by-step guide to tackle slow internet after Windows 10 Update.Step 1. Press Windows shortcut keys Win + R to open Run dialog box. Step 2. Type gpedit.msc and then hit OK. Step 3. Give permissions. A pop-up window will open with title of Group Policy. Step 4. Click on Computer Configuration on the right side of the window. Step 5. Navigate to: Administrative Templates -> Network \u2013 > Qos Packet Scheduler \u2013 > Limit reservable bandwidth.Step 6. Click on Enable. Step 7. Change the Value from 20 to 0. Step 8. Apply and then click OK. 3. Disable Window Auto-Tuning Window Auto-Tuning which is enabled by default improves performance for programs by receiving TCP data over a network. Slower internet speed after Windows 10 Update could hit your computer when Window Auto-Tuning feature is \u201cON\u201d. While luckily, you can disable Windows Auto-Tuning level to improve the internet speed for the Windows 10 update. Use administrator privileges to process the following steps.Step 1. Press Win + X and then select Command Prompt (Admin). Step 2. Type the command netsh interface tcp show global in the window. Step 3. Check for Receive Window Auto-Tuning Level and if it is normal, you will need to disable it.Step 4. Type the command netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled to disable it.You can perform an internet speed test to see whether those adjustments improve your internet speed or not. If not, you can re-enable the Window Auto-Tuning level by typing the command netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=normal in the Command Prompt (Admin).Source: ***Link Removed by Moderator*** Hope the information provided is useful.

In your example (and what I observed just now on my laptop for a folder to folder copy on a Windows 10 device) the options are: \"Replace the file in the destination\" and \"Skip this file\" with the additional option of \"Compare info for both files\" Instead of\u00a0\"Copy and replace\" and \"Don't copy\".So it appears that if the source folder and the destination folder are on different device types, the options are different.However, my original question still remains: \"Why does the copy\/move appear to stop without processing any other files?\" if the \"Do this for all conflicts?\" is selected and \"Don't copy\" is clicked. As near as I can tell, Windows receive sufficient information from the USB device that it can tell if the files are the same date \/ time and the same size.Thanks,Rick.","Microsoft, this is a legit bug that you need to fix.\u00a0 When copying files to a phone SD card over USB, checking \"Do this for all conflicts\" then clicking \"Don't copy\" will inappropriately abort the entire copy operation.","Well, just here to say that I've run into the same bug.
