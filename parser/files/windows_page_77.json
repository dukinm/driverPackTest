Since my initial post, I have learned something new that I want to share because it may lead more quickly to a windows fix.\u00a0I connected my iphone to my windows 7 PC and opened my phone to view its contents.\u00a0I find that I am able to copy photos from my phone to my PC but I am unable to copy videos to my PC (What??).\u00a0I get the same error msg I received previously when attempting to use the windows download process.\u00a0This time there was a little more explanation that referenced a \u201ccompression routine\u201d that perhaps had used a CODEC not recognized by windows.\u00a0These are just words to me \u2013 conveying little useful information \u2013 BUT, does this suggest a windows fix to any technical gurus that may be reading this?","Thank you Bill,Actually, I started investigating my problem by visiting the Apple site.\u00a0As you pointed out, they have a tutorial for how to use windows to download photos and videos from an iphone.\u00a0It\u2019s EXACTLY what I have been doing for many years, except that 2 days ago it stopped working.\u00a0So it is no help at all.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that Apple also has information about using itunes to perform the download \u2013 which is your second point.\u00a0I did not follow through with this because I currently use itunes to manage an extensive music collection and synch it with my ipod.\u00a0A downside to this is that whenever I connect my iphone to my pc, itunes launches automatically and begins trying to synch my music library with my iphone.\u00a0I do not want this because I do not have the space on my phone for this library of thousands of hours of music and if even I did, the initial synch would take many hours for something that is absolutely not wanted.\u00a0Additionally, itunes is very aggressive and it\u2019s time-consuming to cancel it once it has launched.\u00a0I want nothing to do with it.So, I\u2019m looking for a windows solution, which is why I posted to this site. Since my initial post, I have learned something new that I want to share because it may lead more quickly to a windows fix.\u00a0I connected my iphone to my windows 7 PC and opened my phone to view its contents.\u00a0I find that I am able to copy photos from my phone to my PC but I am unable to copy videos to my PC (What??).\u00a0I get the same error msg I received previously when attempting to use the windows download process.\u00a0This time there was a little more explanation that referenced a \u201ccompression routine\u201d that perhaps had used a CODEC not recognized by windows.\u00a0These are just words to me \u2013 conveying little useful information \u2013 BUT, does this suggest a windows fix to any technical gurus that may be reading this?Have you considered what I had at the end of my reply?There is also a link at the end of the above to submit a question to the Apple Community","Thanks Bill.\u00a0\u00a0This is looking like a problem with Windows 7 no longer getting update support and will likely go away when I upgrade to Windows 10.\u00a0\u00a0I plan to do that after my taxes are done so the videos can remain on the phone until then.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, I hope someone reading these 2 posts may have an idea that will fix this more quickly.\u00a0\u00a0There must be other Windows 7 users experiencing this same problem.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, you can relax - I will not be\u00a0\u00a0making any further posts here or with the \u201cApple community\u201d who I\u2019m sure could care less what I can or can\u2019t do with Windows."]},{"symptom":"Pop-ups that keep offering connected experience        In Microsoft Word, I set my privacy settings that I do NOT want connected experiences. \u00a0I just want to type what I need to type, save, print. \u00a0Lately I'm working on a resume and EVERY time I open it I get an MS word pop-up message telling me that I should change my settings to enjoy connected experiences. \u00a0I don't see a way to turn off these annoying messages? \u00a0I'm tempted to use the mac pages which is free and less functional but doesn't bother me every time I open it.\u00a0Please advise.\u00a0","solutions":["Hi MS.

The cpu temperature is fine, does not go over 70 grade celsius, the voltage is fine 1.45v , so i know it is not a problem in the hardware, can i get some information about the windows 10 home edition, if does not support more than 5300 mhz ratio and if i need to buy a Windows 10 Professional. or if i can fix it somehow on win10 home. sorry for my english.","solutions":["There is no such set limit in any version of Windows. You are overclocking. Overclocking stresses all your computer components (memory\/timing and other motherboard components). If you cannot go any faster you have simply reached your configuration's limits. Just keeping components cool at standard voltage or under-volted, does not mean you can overclock indefinitely to whatever frequency you want to without any ill effects.The faster you go above spec, the more instable your computer will be. Minor problems may not cause your computer to fail, major problems or a ton of minor problems will.","Hi Leo, Windows does not support overclocking at all. you overclock components at your own risk.Overclocking changes not software settings but hardware parameters so in General Windows have no relation with overclocking. Only certain hardware may be overclocked more or less.So the answer is NO, Windows 10 does not have such limit."]}]}
