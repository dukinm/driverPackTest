I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Does this happen in another game, app or Windows besides SIMS? If not it points directly to the app only. If so then we need to troubleshoot the mouse or touchpad. Which is it?As you have a laptop I'm going to assume touchpad, so try a mouse to see if it still happens.If not, update the Touchpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, go to Mice > Touchpad and then Driver tab. Choose Update Driver, then Automatic to see if it gets a better driver that resolves the problem. If not try Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick to try all previously installed drivers. If that doesn't work then try uninstalling driver, Restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.See the troubleshooting steps here: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402786...

I'm upgrading from my old Windows 7 Home Premium Edition to the new Windows 10 Home Edition, but when I tried to download Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool, the download never finished no matter how many times I tried to download it. Then I found out on the internet that my Windows 7 OS doesn't support the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool software and that's why I could never finish installing the Windows 10 OS. So, how do I install Windows 10 without the Media Creation Tool? Please remember I'm a novice, so having to use any kind of computer code or anything like that, would just go over my head!LOL By the way, I did find a Microsoft page that had the words Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File) in the title, yet when I go to the Microsoft website, I can't find it anywhere. Below the title, I also saw some wording about being 'routed' to that page because my OS didn't support the Media Creation Tool. I can no longer find that page. I think that page would have allowed me to download the Windows 10 OS without the need of the Media Creation Tool. If someone could send me a link to this exact page I would really appreciate it. Thank you.","solutions":["If you know someone else who has a computer with Windows 10 on it, you could always ask them to create the flash drive installation media. If that's not possible, you have two other options. The Microsoft website detects what kind of operating system you are using and only allows you to download the media creation tool if you are on windows. However, if you have a mac or other device that can access the internet, and you go to the download page (here:\u00a0https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-download\/windows10) it will allow you to download a disk image. You can then move it onto a disk from that device, or transfer it to your computer.Alternatively, if you do not have a device that uses another operating system, you can trick the website into thinking you are using a different OS, but it is somewhat complicated. The instructions are shown in this article:\u00a0https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/427223\/how-to-download-a-windows-10-iso-without-the-media-creation-tool\/If you use this method, don't forget to change it back afterwards.Unfortunately, these are really the only options you have. Hopefully one of them works for you! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Hi EJP,Thank you for the quick reply! Since my Windows 7 seems to be way outdated (I bought my Toshiba laptop back in 2013) that even the Microsoft Media Creation Tool won't work with it, I'm dreading the fact that I will have to shell out big bucks to Microsoft for the retail version. I've been trying to find cheaper ways to get the Windows 10 OS, but nothing seems to work. From trying 'free' validation keys to finding sellers that have the OS on flash drives, I'm at my wits end. Would getting the Windows 10 on a flash drive really work, or are all of these methods just ripoffs to try and take your money. I'm on a disability pension and can't afford to spend close to $200 Canadian for a retail version of the OS for a computer that I still use and need but really don't use as much since getting a new ipad two years ago now. I also don't know of anyone with a computer that would be willing to burn a copy of their Windows 10 OS so I could use it, but I will ask around at work. Again thanks for the quick reply and I will keep looking","If you can get a flash drive with Windows 10 installation media on it, you shouldn't even need a key to activate Windows 10 once it is downloaded. The license from Windows 7 that is already on your computer should transfer over to Windows 10 without you having to pay anything. Also, you don't have to ask someone to burn a copy of their Windows 10 to a flash drive for you. All they have to do is download the media creation tool from the page on Microsoft's website (see my previous comment) and it gives you an option to create an installation media on a flash drive when you run it. Nothing on their computer is transferred onto the drive so they don't need to worry about their files being put onto your computer or anything. It just makes a flash drive that allows you to install windows on your computer. Note that you will need an 8gb or larger flash drive. Once you put the installer on the flash drive, you would then open the flash drive on your computer and start the installer. If you are confused at all about how exactly any of this works, just let me know.","Hi EJP,I already had downloaded and put a copy of the Windows 10 ISO file on a blank DVD disc and tried starting the download off of that. All the times that I tried, the OS download only got so far and then it stopped. Why would the installer work for someone else and not for me? I was also given the option to be able to download the ISO file either onto my computer, a USB drive or a blank DVD. I chose the DVD option but the download was never able to finish. I never even got to the validation key screen. Are you saying that the downloader would work for the other person because they have Windows 10 already installed on their computer. By the way, do you know how I can still get to the Microsoft page that says Download Windows 10 Disc Image (ISO File)? Someone sent me to this website address in my email on my ipad, but when I tried to copy and paste the same address on my computer using both IE and Firefox I only got sent to the generic Microsoft page where you download the Media Creation Tool. The other site also referred to being sent to that particular site because I guess it detected that my current Windows 7 OS wouldn't work with the Media Creation Tool. Was it because I tried to access the page while I was on ipad, which didn't have a Windows based OS on it? Thanks.","Oh, I misunderstood the issue. I thought you were having issues downloading the media creation tool, not Windows 10 itself. In that case, I would try using the media creation tool to download directly onto your computer. You can then just run the file that downloads and the installation should start. If that doesn't work you can also do the flash drive option. I don't know why it would randomly stop part way through installation though. It may be an issue with the disc you are using. I installed Windows 10 onto a Windows 7 computer (it was actually also a Toshiba laptop that I also got in 2013) and didn't have any problems.Also, yes, the reason that you can download the actual ISO on your iPad is because it isn't a Windows-based OS. If you are using Windows, it forces you to download the media creation tool. Just try using the media creation tool to directly download the installer onto your computer and let me know if that works for you. Sorry I misunderstood the problem in my previous comments.","Hi EJP,Thank you for the quick reply!

For this reason most tech enthusiasts Clean Reinstall using the Product Key on the COA sticker affixed to machine. This guide compiles everything that works best in tens of thousands of installs I've directly helped with in forums since Windows 7 beta, and continues my Seven Forums web tutorial with 2+ million views.DetailsPlease read over all steps to be sure you understand them before beginning. Ask back any questions in the Comments section below. For example, it is important enough to understand exactly how drivers are handled in the first mostly driver-complete OS that these steps are printed in red.To save pages of space I provide blue links to illustrated tutorials instead of illustrating them in-line. You can open these in a new tab using your middle mouse button (scroll wheel) or from the right-click context menu.\u00a0 Please notify me in Comments section if any link is faulty, then google the name to get an alternate link for that operation.Step 1Find the right Windows 7 .iso There is a stable source for the WIndows 7 installation media ISO to download your licensed versionhere. I would use 64-bit for 4gb or more RAM, 32-bit (x86) for 3gb or less RAM.You can slipstream the latest Updates into the installer ISO to save at least an hour's Updating after install usingUpdate 7 installation media.\u00a0 However it may take an hour to do this so consider how much you want this.\u00a0 Due to problems with Updates which have recently grown more serious, MS has also just released a rollup you can install or slipstream into media here:\u00a0Simplifying updates for Windows 7 and 8.1 | Windows for IT Pros .\u00a0Burn ISO to DVD or to USB flash stick (minimum size of 4GB required)using Windows 7 USB-DVD Download Tool or alternatively to DVD using ImgBurn\u00a0 at 4x speed, to flash stick usingRufusselecting UEFI for GPT for UEFI BIOS, or Legacy MBR for Legacy BIOS.For UEFI installs format flash stick with Option One of\u00a0\u00a0UEFI Bootable USB Flash Drive - Create in Windows\u00a0 making sure the settings shown in picture don't jump around after adding the ISO.You have a UEFI install if Disk Management shows an EFI System partition on the hard drive, the BIOS shows UEFI settings and it's Boot menu offers to boot the DVD or a UEFI-formatted flash stick as an EFI device.Step 2 Backup your user data If your files are not organized now is a good time to sort them into the User folders for yournamed User account using one of The many ways to copy, move, or delete multiple files.\u00a0 I find\u00a0 the easiest way to do this is to browse on the left-hand Explorer bar to C:\\Users\\[Your User Account] to expand User folders, then in right hand pane browse to all locations with unsorted files and drag them separately or in groups to the desired User folder on Explorer bar. Finally delete unwanted files from each User folder.For all browsers other than IE which stores Favorites in the User folder of that name, exportyour bookmarks to Documents now.\u00a0 Most browsers will also let you set up a sync to store your browser settings, Favorites and history in a Google account, Firefox Sync, or similar:Import or export bookmarks - Chrome HelpSync Chrome data across devicesExport Firefox bookmarks to an HTML file to back up or transfer bookmarksHow do I set up Sync on my computer? | FirefoxIf your email is stored on computer, Google how to back up specific mail and account settings to get solutions likeHow do I import and export email, contacts, and calendars with Windows Live Mail? - Microsoft Windows Help.Backup Quickbooks 2010+ Company files from where you keep them, the default location User\/Public\/Documents, or google your version's file location, or run a QB backup to Documents before backing them up.De-authorize I-Tunes. You can back up your Sticky Notes to keep the one currently on your desktop followingSticky Notes - Backup and Restore.Then back up your files externally by dragging or copying your named User account or active User folders to another hard drive, external drive, flash stick or disk.\u25b6 Copying files to an external drive - YouTube. An alternative is to upload files to the cloud using Microsoft OneDrive which offers 15gb free storage for each Outlook\/Live ID. Install and use the OneDrive app to drag User folders into OneDrive folder, monitor uploading progress by clicking Cloud icon in System Tray on bottom right end of taskbar. Once files are all uploaded, rightclick the Cloud Icon again to choose Settings and Unlink so that any accidental file deletions are not deleted in the Cloud. Step 7 will pick up with reinstalling OneDrive to recover your files. Remember that any accidental deletions always end up in OneDrive's as well as your PC's Recycle Bin. For unbootable Windows copy data to another HD or USB device using the Windows 7 disk toCopy & Paste in Windows Recovery Console, free Paragon rescue disk, or a Linux boot disk. You can Run and print an audit of hardware and software including installed Product Keys usingBelarc Advisor.\u00a0 This audit assures you won't lose any paid software keys like Office. Note that the Windows 7 Product Key found by Belarc or another key finder will be an SLP batch key used at factory, if it has not yet been activated from COA sticker Key used for a Clean Reinstall. This SLP batch key cannot be used for reinstall. Methods for backing up Factory SLP Activation if the COA Product Key is not readable are not supported here but can be found on the web. For unbootable Windows, you can read the installed Product Key and any Office key you don't have backed up usingProduKey - Recover lost product key (CD-Key) of Windows\/MS-Office\/SQL ServerStep 3 Save essential system data If you have a Recovery partition it may not run after clean reinstall. You may want to make your Recovery Disks so you have a path back to factory condition, following the steps given in your PC's setup literature or in the Manual located on the Support Downloads webpage for your model computer. As an alternative to Recovery Disks you cansave a Windows 7 Backup Image or more flexible\u00a0Macrium Reflect Freeimage of the entire HD. You can wait until afterward to see if Recovery or (Diagnostics) Tools partitions will run from boot to decide if you want to delete those partitions and recover the space into C or elsewhere (using Step 3here). This information may be provided for your brand PC in the Special Notes at the end of this tutorial.Write down the Product Key from COA sticker located on back or side of PC tower, bottom or under battery of notebook. Make sure you get the characters correct as this is a main cause of activation failure. You can input or Skip the key during install then afterwards activate at Control Panel>System, which may require a quick robocall. But put the key in a safe place so you have it for the life of the PC, which may outlast the sticker's readability.The COA sticker looks like this: Step 4 Manage installed programs Gather your program installers. For those lacking disks, you may find them on the program's Support Downloads webpage. Favorite pre-installed apps may be found on the Downloads webpage for your model computer or manufacturer-provided Apps Disk. Others may be found by googling.\u00a0 Some pre-installed apps may not be available for clean reinstall - more about this for your brand PC in the Special Notes at end.If needed, Office reinstallation media can be obtained viaManage, Download, Backup, & Restore Microsoft Office Products\u00a0and activated with the Product Key you originally bought with it or audited usingBelarc Advisor orProduKey.\u00a0 A good free compatible alternative to Office isLibreOffice Free Office Suite or OpenOffice.\u00a0 You can also Try Office 365 for free to trial the new subscription Office suite fully integrated into the cloud.Many of the favorite apps needed and desired for reinstall are available in the terrific appNinite - Install or Update Multiple Apps at Once.\u00a0 This makes a custom installer you can save which keeps all app installers updated within.Just in case, save in advance your Wireless or Ethernet LAN (wired) driver in your backup so if it isn't provided during install you can install it to get online quickly to install all Important and Optional Windows Updates - which will also provide most drivers. Your network LAN driver can be found on the Support Downloads webpage for your model PC. The exact make\/model will be listed in your Device Manager under Network Adapters.Step 5 Install the Windows 7 .iso Unplug all other HD's and peripherals except ethernet cable to increase chances of it starting up connected after install. If not prompted for wireless key during install it's likely you'll need to install the wireless driver immediately after getting to the desktop, or if ethernet LAN is working wait for wireless driver to come in via Windows Update.Follow How to Enter Your PC's BIOS, near the storage settings make sure SATA controller setting is AHCI, then under Boot tab set the hard drive first to boot (unless you don't have a BIOS boot menu key in which case you need to set your Installation media device first to boot), Save Settings and Exit.\u00a0If in doubt about whether you have a UEFI BIOS, comb the settings for UEFI, EFI, CSM, Legacy BIOS, Secure Boot - if none of these are present then you don't have a UEFI BIOS.\u00a0 If you have UEFI, check the PC or mobo's Support downloads webpage for latest firmware to install if necessary now.\u00a0 Reboot tapping BIOS boot menu key to trigger installation media, as a UEFI\/EFI device if you have a UEFI BIOS.\u00a0 Choose Custom Install, then at the \"Where do you want to Install Windows?\" screen access the Drive Options (Advanced) to delete all partitions to Unallocated Space, create New and Format as desired, or just click Next to let the Installer auto-create and format needed partitions and begin install.\u00a0Whether to use more than one partition depends largely if you want your data in the OS partition, or have it linked from another partition to make C partition backup image smaller - this way if Windows 7 becomes irreparable you can re-image the OS\/Programs to C and the data will be current and waiting safely in its own partition. Due to lack of SP2 Win7 has no USB3 drivers so use a USB2 port for flash install; it may be necessary to disable USB3 controller in BIOS setup for install. If you're prompted for drivers for any other reason during install it almost always means a bad installer, so make sure ISO download completed and create another one.If you have an UEFI BIOS, or receive an error that Win7 cannot be installed to disk because of its formatting, and cannot overcome the error by deleting all partitions, then you may need to follow the special steps toInstall Windows 7 with UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface)including if necessary to Create UEFI Bootable USB Flash Drive, or mayBypass UEFI to Install WIn7.\u00a0 Remember to boot installer as UEFI Device.\u00a0 We can help troubleshoot UEFI problems as we do here every day.Other Steps here to Troubleshoot Windows 7 Installation Failures - Windows 7 Help ForumsStep 6 Get online to run all Windows Updates Immediately after install check bottom right System Tray network icon to connect to your network if necessary. If only a TV icon with a red slash appears then open and extract network LAN driver, right click on Setup to Run as Administrator, install LAN driver watching System tray icon to choose network if required. Why can't I connect to a network? - Windows HelpImmediately after getting online install your AV. I suggest using a lightweight free Antivirus likeMicrosoft Security Essentials or the more aggressive Panda Cloud which perform well with the Windows 7 Firewall. Bloated AV's cause problems with Win7; if you're infected while using MSE I suggest adding inexpensive Malwarebytes Real Time Protection which also work together well.Next enable hardware driver auto-updating,open Windows Update to Check for Updates, select all Important and Optional Updates (except Bing, unless you prefer it) to install. After requested reboots, go back again to Check for Updates until there are no more. These Updates deliver drivers, critical system, hardware and security patches. I would accept them all to be safest, keep Updates set to Automatic and regularly check for Optional to install because often needed Updates are queued there.If Updates stall or balk check your Start menu's Shutdown button for a \"!\" signaling there are Updates queued there for install at Shutdown. Perform a Shutdown to install them and then keep an eye on the Shutdown button if further rounds of Updates stall to clear them there first before proceeding to again Check for Updates. Most Update jams can be resolved by several reboots - real problems are one in a million.If Updates will not install at all or endlessly Check for Updates, go into Windows Update \"Change Settings\" and set it to Never Check for Updates,\u00a0 download and install manuallyWindows Updates KB3020369, followed by a restart and then KB3172605, then restart again.\u00a0 Now Check for Updates and they should appear.\u00a0 Install all Important and Optional, with necessary Restarts.\u00a0 Once all Updates are installed you can Change Settings again to Install Updates Automatically.\u00a0Any drivers still missing in Device Manager after all Important and Optional Updates are installed can be found on the Support Downloads webpage for the model PC or device, along with other OEM software which you can wait to see if you need. I would not replace any drivers given by the installer or Windows Update unless performance problems point to that specific driver. We can help you troubleshoot these issues. If you install a driver and it performs badly you can Roll Back on its Driver tab in Device Manager.\"Standard VGA\" Display driver is a placeholder driver which only should be used when no other possible driver will install as it will not allow Sleep or Hibernate. So if Updates don't provide a better driver, import it from the PC model's Support Downloads webpage - if necessaryeven Vista, or XP driver installed inCompatibility Mode.\u00a0If this fails check the device maker's Support Downloads webpage to let it scan for the needed download to install.Unknown Devices are often card reader drivers posted on the model's Support Downloads webpage along with other drivers which may be revealed by a function still missing on the PC such as laptop function keys or keyboard lighting, or can be traced using Device Manager - Finding Unknown Devices - Windows 7 Help ForumsCo-processor, SM Bus controller, USB and Storage controllers are often elements of the chipset. If no chipset is posted on your model's Downloads page, use theIntel Drive Update Utility orAMD Auto-Detect to find your chipset, or ask in our Drivers forum. You can also trace any missing driver using Hardware Identification. It's often faster to google the Driver Detail's Hardware ID than to look it up.I would not re-import any of the OEM software until you run for awhile to know for sure you need it. There may be patches on the PC's Support Downloads webpage needed to improve performance so browse them to be aware what's available as you test performance to decide if they're needed. But keep in mind re-installing OEM bloatware besides that which is absolutely needed for good performance ora specific function you need defeats the purpose of a Clean Reinstall.Step 7 Reinstall your programs Install programs slowly over time to gauge performance changes after each. You can roll back bad effects of a Program install or Update(s) by uninstalling it or usingSystem Restore.Install your preferred Reader and Flash Player declining the Optional offer. I no longer recommend installing Java unless you know you need it or are prompted to install it to run a program, as it is an infection path.Don't let programs write themselves into msconfig>Startup as they slow startup, become freeloaders on your RAM\/CPU, can spy on you and cause conflicts. No video, sound or other driver software needs to start with Windows 7 unless you know you need special settings on these. As illustrated in Startup Programs - Change\u00a0 uncheck everything except AV, gadgets (aka \"Sidebar\"), Sync program, printer which scans from printer top, and Flash player updater (needed for safety and performance) in msconfig>Startup.Then after reboot do the same in msconfig>Services after checking the box to \"Hide All MS Services.\"Check back with both lists periodically to see if anything writes itself back in, turn it off in its Program Preferences.If you have any questions about a listing, Google it to learn what it does or ask us.However I would not install any Google programs which are relentless spyware. Only use the stable Google search box in your browser and don't stay signed into any Google web apps.Avoid spyware tracking cookies placing annoying interest ads by periodically\u00a0Opting Out of Network Advertising.This will greatly relieve the banner ads which track your shopping habits and web searches.The most important thing you can do to avoid spyware creeping in is to watch your program installs like a hawk at every step, because freeware authors have found ingenious ways to sneak in spyware with tricky check box choices - even in the License Agreement. Always do a Custom install and only allow the features you know you want, check later to remove anything extra in Control Panel>Programs and by running a full Malwarebytes andAdwCleaner scan (Step 12) which roots them out as deep as they can go.Keep an eye also on your Browser Add-Ons or Extensions to only allow the ones you know you want or are required to make a page display correctly, including Flash, Shockwave, WMP or Quicktime plug-in, a reader, Silverlight. Also under Add-Ons monitor Search services to remove any but Google in the stable browser search box, tick the box to disallow any others to replace it.Strange search service are often spyware.If you're prone to infection add the inexpensive paid real-time protection forMalwarebytesto run alongside a lightweight recommended AV, otherwise use its excellent free scanner as needed.Step 8 Recover your user files Before copying your files into the new install, now would be a good time to download, install (declining trial), update and run a scan on them withMalwarebytes to make sure no infection is being re-imported.If you backed up to OneDrive, reinstall the OneDrive App, wait for files to download from OneDrive into the OneDrive folder completely, then copy them into User folders, ormove the User folders of the new Install into the OneDrive folder to Sync, Backup and Store your Files to the Cloud with OneDrive.To copy your files into the new install, open the storage folder, open each User folder (Documents, Pictures, etc.). Next from the Organize tab choose Select All, drag the group to the corresponding folder on Explorer bar at left.Wait until the bar stops unfolding and hypertext confirms the precise copy location before releasing the left click.If this method makes you nervous, right click on the Select All file group to Copy, then open the corresponding target user folder, in an empty space right click to Paste.Do not copy hidden AppData folders from User Accounts as these are a corruption path- another reason not to use file transfer apps which can also lose files.If you're using a separate data partition copy your User folders to it, then you can either move the new install's active User folders location to there followingUser Folders - Change Default Location, or right click each to link it to the related Library - Include a Folder then set it as default for that Library - Set Save Folder - Windows 7 Help Forums. Keep the empty C User folder in each library so you can easily see if something lands there and simply drag it to the linked User folder.If you move the User folders use another Backup Imaging app like free Macrium Reflectas the built-in one will want to include the data drive which now holds System files.A simple free method is here to Sync, Backup and Store your Files to the Cloud with Onedrive - Windows 7 Help Forums that shows how to move your User folders into OneDrive folder on C or data partition for instant backup to the cloud and simultaneous synching across all of your devices using this method.The User Favorites folder will populate IE Bookmarks.

However some users like to have a more current image to choose from in which case I'd save a separate one as often as you want. Win7 imaging will save past images as long as there is enough room on the storage drive for a new image.Note that built-in Win7 backup imaging is limited to restoring the OS to the exact same partition structure, so if you want a more flexible app try favorite freeMacrium Reflect.\u00a0 Once you load the image and target hard drive, use the links under each existing partition to delete those you're replacing, then just drag your desired partitions to the target drive, note the new link created just below each to use sliders to adjust its size, then click Next using the default settings.Step 12 Notes for specific PC makes Henceforth if required to contact your OEM Tech Support do not tell them you Clean Reinstalled but troubleshoot as if you have the factory install. Otherwise they may refuse to support Clean Reinstall, but cannot void Hardware warranty. If you must ship the unit back for repair under Hardware warranty save a Windows 7 backup image and then run Factory Recovery beforehand.Special notes for HP owners:On newer models HP System Recovery\u00a0 may offer a Minimized OS Recovery option. This retains only the OS, Recovery Manager, HP Support Asst, HP Wireless LAN, drivers and activation, and is as close to a clean reinstall as you can get without doing one yourself. I would uninstall HP Wireless to use Win7's superior wireless manager.If you format and reinstall only to C leaving all other partitions intact, F11 Recovery key should still work later if you need it. The helpful hardware diagnostics also listed on the ESC or F9 boot menu may also run after reinstall, so if they will run now from boot, I would save the small HP Tools partition to see if they remain bootable after install.Problems with volume control lighting and HP Quick Launch buttons have been dealt withhere and here. Specific HP software which might be worth reimporting is discussed in HP Bloatware, or useful system utilities? Some HP Recovery disks can have their files extracted to access favorite program installers usingAccessing HP Recovery Disc Files.Special notes for Dell owners:If your Recovery partition is triggered at boot from the F8 System Recovery Options\u00a0 then it will no longer run after clean reinstall, somake your Recovery disks first, delete Recovery partition during reinstall. The bootable Dell Diagnostics often will run after Reinstall so are worth saving if they will boot. Try it now to test your hardware and see if these work, choosing on F12 menu Diagnostics and then Utility Partition which sometimes has a fuller suite. If they run save the Dell Utility partition during install, if not delete all partitions. These tests can also be run online atDell PC Diagnostics | Dell USUseful tips for Dell re-installation plus access to their forums to resolve questions can be found atDell Community .\u00a0 The Dell Reinstallation DVD has only activation and a Dell logo added and can be used as long as it is labeled to include SP1.Special Note for Sony Vaio Owners:Software which enables F-key functions and illumination must be reinstalled from the Sony Support Downloads webpage in the order as shown here:Function keys don't work after clean install - Windows 7 Forums Special Note for Samsung Owners:Software which enables F-key functions and illumination may be labeled Easy Display Manager.Special Note to Acer OwnersThere is an OEM Preload folder hidden in the C:\/ drive that holds all the pre-loaded software, including the eRecovery software.Special Note for Lenovo OwnersThe only OEM software I've found to be valuable is Lenovo Energy Management's features to preserve battery by maintaining a 60% charge when plugged in, and fan reversal to clean out dust.
