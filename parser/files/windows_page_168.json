Pretty sure all drivers are uptodate. The other machine I checked wss runnkng a 2017 realtrk driver so even rolled back to that but nothing.","well if you had the chance to test it, you can make sure that this isn't a hardware issue on this laptop,You can upgrade to 1909 if you are up to it, but there's no known issues in 1903 related to card readers in general..","I'll see what I can do.
