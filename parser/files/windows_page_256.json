I am not sure when this issue started (out of the box or after 3rd party apps installed).There is an issue with changing between upper and lower case using the CAPS lock key. The key works, in that the light comes on, but in whatever application is focused at the time, the text does not change to upper case. If you click focus away and then back to the application, the text is now uppercase. This is the same if typing in uppercase and then changing to lower case.Some testing done;Bought up on-screen keyboard. Pressing the physical CAPS lock key (cycling) has the on screen keyboard correctly toggle the caps lock state.If you were in lower case and changed to upper case, typing on the hardware keyboard remains in lower case, however type by using the on screen keyboard has text in uppercase.The shift button has text displayed correctly as upper case.Plugging in an external USB keyboard results in the same, incorrect behavior.It clearly appears to not be a hardware issue, but something software related. Has anyone any idea why the change in CAPS lock state only registers if you focus away from and then back to the application being used? This is the same for Windows search box, notepad, and command line.","solutions":["Unable to find a reason for the issue we reset the laptop back to factory which resolved the issue.
