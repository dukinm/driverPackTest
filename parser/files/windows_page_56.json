The server is not on heavy load, has plenty available memory and disk space, up to date.Yes, it's every 26 hours.

Windows Defender Cache Maintenance3. Windows Defender Cleanup4. Windows Defender Verification#1 is ok. It has one trigger defined to run at 2:30am everyday, and always run at scheduled time (at around 2:30~2:50am everyday)#2,#3 and #4 are the tasks that run every 26 hours(none of them has trigger).\u00a0 Task history shows they were running 5:02am on day 1, then 7:02am on day 2, 9:02am on day 3.
