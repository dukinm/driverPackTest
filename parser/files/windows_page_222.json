As the title suggests, I am trying to figure out the cause of one of my drives disappearing from \"Drives and Device\" and requiring me to set it up again through Disk Management.Full story being; I had done a clean install of windows and completely reset my computer yesterday morning. I had to set up one of my storage drives through Disk Management.(I use a smaller SSD for purely Windows, along with some other important programs like GeForce Experience and the like. I also have a normal Hard Drive and another SSD for storage, both are 1TB's. The SSD, not for Windows, is the one that needed to be set up with Disk Management)So I had done that, given it the drive letter and gone through that whole process.\u00a0 The SSD for storage was working completely fine throughout the entire day.I start up my computer today and realise that my SSD isnt listed under \"Drives and Devices\". Since I had only just done a fresh install of Windows, there wasn't much on it, so not much time was lost. Before setting it up in Disk Management again, I changed the cables around to different plugs to see if I could possibly restore it but that didn't work so I went ahead with setting it up.I'm not too bothered by the time lost, I am worried though about how it may have happened and if it might happen again. This is a newish drive and this is the first time that has happened to me. It hadn't happened even before the fresh Windows install.If someone could be able to tell me what the issue may have been, if it's likely to happen again and if it's something to be worried about, that would be great.
