Completely unusable. So I am forced to use Windows Ink instead of any third-party driver, since it's the only thing that works.\u00a0The problem, though, is that I have another monitor that I want to be my primary display. But when I use the tablet, it only works on whatever display is set as my \"primary\" display. So when I set my regular monitor as my primary display, the pen's cursor appears on my regular monitor. It only works when I set the small pen display as my primary display, which I do not like. It is annoying to have programs (especially games) open on the small screen off to the side, and very annoying to not have the notification tray on my main monitor.Is there a way around this? Some sort of setting I can change, a registry entry I can tweak, so that I can make Windows Ink work on a secondary display?

So in general terms, indexing must be working properly.So why is it that when I search entire the Documents folder for this same unusual name, I get no return really, just the green bar going slowly all the away across, except for the final X, and then I continue to see indefinitely the message \"working on it\". For sure the search indexing function is searching subfolders because I can drag the target document down to a new lower level of subfolder, and I still get the correct file name returned.The Documents folder is 41 GB, but 28 GB of that is Outlook files. Is the search process perhaps getting indefinitely delayed in the giant Outlook folder? Maybe, I just don't know. But to bypass the big Outlook folder in an indexed search, I would have to move it temporarily out of Documents as a workaround. I have not tried that because it seems like there should be a better and routine way to do a simple index search of the document folder, when you already know index searching is generally working correctly.Is the search getting hung up because one particular Document subfolder lacks the system permission? I don't know if that happens, but it is a thought. Finding the problem subfolder does not sound like an easy task.Bottom line: Indexing and indexed content searching is working well, except from the Documents folder level, which is often the most useful level because you don't have to try to figure out which subfolder a specific document content might be in.Does anyone have any other thoughts or directions for the above problem definition, or perhaps is also experiencing it?
