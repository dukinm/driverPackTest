Interesting the troubled gamessystem specs are different. Particularly Warface using only DX9.- Are the games flashing on the setup screens or only when loading the game play ?- Have the games been modded ?- Do you have Nvidia's DSR\u00a0 option enabled ? I have a couple of games that have issues with DSR enabled, but I don'trecall if they caused flashing before the game locked up. - Have you reinstalled the current Nvidia driver since 'rolling back' to an older driver ? If not it would be best to reinstall the current driver(when 'rolling back' avoid doing so via Device Manager. If not using the driver updater in the 'Experience' it's better to uninstallvia Programs and Features, reboot and install an older driver from\u00a0 Nvidia's download site\u00a0 ).- Are you using any graphics or system 'optimising' software such as MSI Afterburner ?

I reckon it's best to try and sort out the issues at hand..","Appreciate the response. To answer the first it is never consistent on where it crashes with Dawn of War 2 Retribution it crashes after you open the game and get past the opening cinematic, with Dawn of War 3 it will crash either as soon as it loads the level or will let you play for several minutes, Cuisine Royale let me play a full game and when I came back to the main lobby screen I collected a few rewards and then it crashed, with Warface it will allow me to search for a game and mess around in the shooting range pre lobby warm up but then crashes when I assume it finds a game(I don't get a notification or anything for finding a game it just crashes after sitting in queue for a bit). The crashes aren't consistent which makes this whole diagnosing that much harder. I have also done a clean boot a few different times with no change either. The Windows Driver Foundation does not appear on my system at all which concerns and confuses me as well, and when downloading the file it also had no effect on the issue. I talked with Nvidia support and they had given me a link to go and download a previous driver and I did reinstall the current driver as well but still have the same issues. All of my Windows updates and drivers are all up to date I have also tried uninstalling the Graphics Card driver in Device manager and restarting to allow it to reinstall itself. I can post the Event Viewer errors I have encountered if that would give any more helpful info. Also I did register the dll when I initially tried to register it I got an error saying it did not exist in the binary which led me to find that I did in fact not have that dll or WDF present on my system. I do not have any other optimizing software other than what Nvidia Geforce experience offers. I have even tried dropping the graphic settings of the games but it does not help either.

Microsoft originally designed Windows with the idea that each user stores their files in their own user account, which is also known as their user profile. For example, userA would store their files like this:C:\\Users\\userA\\DocumentsC:\\Users\\userA\\MusicC:\\Users\\userA\\PicturesC:\\Users\\userA\\VideosIt's very important to follow this model, because these are the folders where Windowsexpects us to store our personal files. For this reason, these folders are never touched when Microsoft updates Windows 10. If we store our personal files anywhere else, where Windows doesn't expect them to be, our files may very well get erased when Windows is updated. This is particularly true for the semi-annual feature updates, which can and do make wholesale changes to Windows.More recently, Microsoft has (finally) joined the rest of the computing industry, which increasingly stores users' personal files online (aka, 'the cloud'.) There are very good reasons for doing this, but that's a different topic.Unfortunately, Microsoft is implementing this change in its usual, confusing, ham-fisted way, which sends users running to this forum asking 'what the ...' So here's how it works:Google (who came first) and Microsoft both have apps (applications, programs) that make it easy for us to store our personal files in 'the cloud,' which - for Google - is called Google Drive and - for Microsoft - is called OneDrive. You can think of the app as a tunnel, because that's really what it is. You drop files into one end of the tunnel - located on your computer - and they slide through the tunnel and come out the other end - the cloud.The part of the tunnel that opens into your computer is represented by a folder. For Windows 10, the folder is called - wait for it - One Drive. Thus, once you put a file into the OneDrive folder, it falls into the tunnel and comes out in OneDrive. Google Drive works similarly, as do Apple and Amazon.Now here's where it gets unnecessarily complicated: When you put a file or a folder into the OneDrive folder, the file or folder\u00a0continues to appear in the OneDrive folder, which gives you the impression that it's still on your computer, except it's not - it only looks that way. In reality, it's on OneDrive. So when you make changes to that file or to that folder, you are actually making changes to the file or folder on OneDrive.This is why I\u00a0personally don't bother with the OneDrive app or the Google Drive app. Instead, I upload files directly to OneDrive and Google Drive, by opening them with my web browser and dragging files onto the web page. Similarly, I work with those files and folders directly in OneDrive and Google Drive. Now there is no confusion about where my files are located.With all this as background, I will (at last!) get to your questions:1- You very definitely should consolidate your users' personal files into as few places as possible. For files that your users want to keep on the computer, store those files\u00a0only in each user's personal profile. Not only does that make it easy to find them, they won't ever get erased by an update. (Which doesn't mean that you don't have to back them up anyway.)For files that your users want to keep in the cloud, store them directly in OneDrive and work with them directly in OneDrive. Microsoft makes that easy to do.If, instead, your users want to store their personal files in the OneDrive folder, it's not my place to say 'no, don't do that.' But because I don't work that way myself, I don't feel qualified to provide advice.2- There are two reasons why it's not a good idea to upload many gigabytes of data to cloud storage at one time: 1) ISPs typically provide severe caps on upload speed (for their own reasons) and cloud storage websites also apply a cap. Both OneDrive and Google Drive have buttons you can click on to cancel uploads in progress.","Thanks so much for the reply. This nightmare started at least 8-10 years ago with a hard drive with a bunch of bad sectors.\u00a0 The shop I took it to decided first to partition, then because my husband couldn't find the files he wanted, the guy made both of us as users (gldn and JaciS). Then my husband took a bunch of my files (like pictures)\u00a0 and copied them to his space.\u00a0From there the monster just grew.\u00a0 When I finally replaced that computer the shop set up another user Jaci5 ( I think it was a typo for JaciS) and copied everything from both users files into that group.\u00a0 Now I have a lot of things triplicated on the computer.\u00a0I just got the new laptop a couple days ago and wanted to sync the pc and laptop.\u00a0 Now we are up to yesterday.\u00a0Today I moved everything to SIEHLS and in doing so reorganized and consolidated.\u00a0 I ended up removing over 60,000 files (including music, photos, and files in there as many as 4 times).\u00a0 Now everything is neat and clean.\u00a0I would now like to remove the extra users.\u00a0 Also yesterday a Micosoft support person set up OneDrive, but it was wrong.\u00a0 I don't want everything on the cloud.....just files I am working on so I can do stuff at lunch and not haul my computer around.\u00a0 I was supposed to have a folder on my desktop called SYNC TO OD to drag and drop files in.\u00a0 But when I opened it this morning my file wasn't there.\u00a0 And I was over the max for the free account.\u00a0 I was told to just remove files from there I didn't want on the cloud.\u00a0 But every time I moved a bunch out it automatically filled the open space because it had my pictures folder select to sync.\u00a0 I had to pay for extra space just so I could get caught up.I fixed my syncing folder EXCEPT with a heavy finger I grabbed the music folder instead of 3 songs.\u00a0 I think right now I just need to let it do its thing and when it is done in a few days I can fix it.\u00a0 Your opinion?","I fixed my syncing folder EXCEPT with a heavy finger I grabbed the music folder instead of 3 songs.\u00a0 I think right now I just need to let it do its thing and when it is done in a few days I can fix it.\u00a0 Your opinion?Whether you cancel the upload now or let it go on to completion is really up to you. If you want to have all those files in OneDrive, let it go on. But realize that the upload to OneDrive is using the upload bandwidth from your ISP, so there's less upload bandwidth available for other uploading that you may wish to do.I didn't get into this earlier because that post was long enough (!) but the way Microsoft has over-complicated the OneDrive app (in my view) is by making it more than just the tunnel I spoke of earlier. Instead, the OneDrive folder is supposed to be a combination of what's in OneDrive and what's on your computer. That's very confusing and causes lots of problems for people who post here.Again, this is only my opinion, but what's in OneDrive is one thing and what's on your hard drive is a separate thing. This is how Google handles Google Drive. I see no point in mixing files from separate places together.Your computer should have 3 or possibly 4 user accounts:A computer should have one (and only one) user account with Administrators permissions, for tasks that require elevated permissions. In practice, you'll rarely need to sign in to that user account.All other user accounts should be Users accounts, also known as Standard accounts or Limited accounts or whatever Microsoft decides to call them next week. So, one Users account for you and one Users account for your husband, and possibly a third users account for use by guests in your house.","You are person after my own heart!\u00a0 All I want is a computer to do my work and a place to backup filez and an easy way to take my work with me when I need to.\u00a0 I think I'll go back to dumping OneDrive and use a flash drive for portable files and an externak hard drive and sync me laptop and pc as backups.\u00a0 It worked like that for the past 10 years.\u00a0 I lost everything in a fire a year ago, but I grabbed my pc & laptop and never missed a file.","Glad that I could help."]},{"symptom":"Windows can't be repaired        I have a Lenovo IdeaPad 520.

Even ones that have been working without issues for years have been a cause of this. I don't know this for sure, but I think the issue has something to do with my hard drive and Windows Update.The whole thing may have started back in September when my PC crashed. Back then I got a blue screen and after that it wouldn't boot up properly anymore. I can't remember how I fixed it back then anymore, but no further crashes occured after that, so I didn't investigate any further. What was noticeable, however, was that my PC was somewhat slower after that and disc usage was often at 100%. Also, Windows updates didn't install themselves anymore. I assume some system files were damaged back then.Anyway, as I mentioned, my PC started crashing constantly two weeks ago, but only when I was trying to play games that were very demanding of it. I ran a bunch of the repair programs Windows provides (eventually, all of them said that they managed to fix the problems), did a bunch of research on the internet but still wasn't able to fix the problem properly. What I managed to do, however, was to get Windows Update to install updates again, except for two (Windows 8.1 KB3063843-x64 and Windows 8.1 KB2990967-x64). I installed them manually just now, yet they still show up when I search for updates, which seems weird to me.Also, the Windows Reliability monitor shows that almost every time when a crash occured the Origin Web Helper crashed (marked with a red X), making it seem like this is somehow related to this as well. I disabled it just now, so I'm not sure if this was any impact on the whole thing or not. I also disabled Windows Problem Reporting because it often caused high disc usage.Here is my PC info: \u00a0OS: Windows 8.1 (64 bit system)\u00a0Processor: Intel Core i5-4460 CPU @ 3.20GHz\u00a0RAM: 8GB\u00a0Graphic card: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960\u00a0HDD: Toshiba DT01ACA100I also ran the sfc \/scannow command and it told me that there were some issues with files that it wasn't able to fix.Here are some of the parts from the CBS.log that stick out:2020-01-05 12:00:19, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Loaded Servicing Stack v6.3.9600.19459 with Core: C:\\Windows\\winsxs\\amd64_microsoft-windows-servicingstack_31bf3856ad364e35_6.3.9600.19459_none_fa42f0179b24f5c2\\cbscore.dll2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CSI\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 00000001@2020\/1\/5:11:00:20.012 WcpInitialize (wcp.dll version 0.0.0.6) called (stack @0x7ffffd277fc9 @0x7ffffd554914 @0x7ffffd55414b @0x7ff7c252d69a @0x7ff7c252e55b @0x7ff830ef2113)2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQM: Initializing online with Windows opt-in: False2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQM: Cleaning up report files older than 10 days.2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQM: Requesting upload of all unsent reports.2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQM: Failed to start upload with file pattern: C:\\Windows\\servicing\\sqm\\*_std.sqm, flags: 0x2 [HRESULT = 0x80004005 - E_FAIL]2020-01-05 12:00:20, Info\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CBS\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 SQM: Failed to start standard sample upload.

Sometimes it may take running thesfc \/scannow command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.If not, then run the Dism \/Online \/Cleanup-Image \/RestoreHealth command to repair any component store corruption, Repair-WindowsImage -Online -CheckHealthRepair-WindowsImage -Online -ScanHealthRepair-WindowsImage -Online -RestoreHealthRestart the PC afterwards, and try the sfc \/scannow command again.If still not, then try using OPTION ONE above to run the sfc \/scannow command at bootIf still not, then you could do a refresh of Windows 8, or run aSystem Restore using a restore point dated before the bad file occured to fix it. You may need to repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the OPTION THREE section\u00a0to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.","Another thing to look at is system temp.\u00a0 You say the problem happens when you have heavy loads.\u00a0 Could it be that your system is overheating?\u00a0 There are various utilities you can download for free that will help you monitor your system temps..Open your computer case and check to see that air flow isn't blocked by dust bunnies."]}]}
