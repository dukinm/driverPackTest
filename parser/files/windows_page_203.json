{"windows":[{"symptom":"I really don't want my computer to update again        Hello, I'm here with yet another problem with Windows update.I've had problems with \"How to update Windows 1803 to 1903?\" as you can see in my profile, it has been answered but it just made further problems for me.My computer is a low-end laptop and actually can't handle the Windows updates. Windows itself installs the drivers that are needed for the new Windows automatically but this is actually my exact problem! As my computer is a weak one, unfortunately (and surprisingly) it somehow can't handle the drivers for it's own graphic cards.I tried my best to install them from many ways: AMD driver installer, Device manager, Copying files into their destination (which was a stupid action to do), etc. but there's no way I can install drivers up to 2015. It doesn't install the Display driver and causes Win crash, overheating, glitches and I can't even lighten up or down my monitor or use night light!Anyways, as you know, the new Windows (1903 and up) needs 2019 or better drivers for the graphic cards, I can't install them and if I even stay on 2015, it causes Windows to crash.All I need now, is how to disable the automatic updates? I tried two ways that I found on internet, but I'm not sure if that's going to do any help. Now I just paused the updates but I'm running out of time...if anyone's here that can help me, I'd appreciate it!And oh, this is one of the two ways I tried:1- I edited my registry. I made a dword (in Windows update key) and named it \"NoAutomaticUpdate\" and I put it on true, if I'm guessing right.I can't remember the last one.I asked a friend about this, and he said that I have to change my graphic cards, but I can't do this because of two reasons, one is that graphic cards are very expensive in where I live, and the second one is that it's too risky to change a notebook's graphic cards. I just want the updates to stop, or at least only Windows update. I don't have any problems with other updates, only Windows update. Thank you.","solutions":["have you read the question carefully?
