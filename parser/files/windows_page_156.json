Then, you can simply drag the window using the title bar at the top of the window, across to the other monitor.Another way to do this is to hold down the Windows key, and press the left or right arrow key, which will move the document window to one half of the screen, and you can keep pressing the arrow key to reach the other monitor, and then maximize the screen.I hope this has helped you.

I got a 2tb Seagate hard drive and decided to download some Itch.io games onto said hard drive; but, upon playing the games on this laptop, I've noticed that my left mouse button takes a couple clicks to register in some games, doesn't work while using WASD in others, and some, works fine. The problem seems to only occur in first person games. I am not using an external mouse, and the only thing plugged in aside from the power cord is my 2tb hard drive.Is there any way I can fix this? I'd really like to play these games without problems.","solutions":["Hi HS. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.I've noticed they recently stopped allowing games to move to slower hard drives due to performance issues. Is this new hard drive a slower drive than your Windows C drive? Moving apps to a HDD from an SSD gives markedly slower response. Better to move the User folders if you need space as they suffer no speed differential. Try installing some games on C to compare. I notice you refer to mouse and then say you aren't using an external mouse. Is this the touchpad then? If so Update the Touchpad driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you also have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. If that doesn't help then enter Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, go to Mice > Touchpad and then Driver tab. Choose Update Driver, then Automatic to see if it gets a better driver that resolves the problem. If not try Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick to try all previously installed drivers. If that doesn't work then try uninstalling driver, Restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver.See the troubleshooting steps here: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402786... Go to Settings > Devices > Touchpad to go over the Settings. Then choose Additional Settings which opens the Mouse properties box. The Touchpad software installs a tab onto it - usually the last one - that should have more settings to check, including a checkbox to Disable Touchpad when USB pointing device is attached. This prevents palm drag from causing the cursor to jumpIf this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Update History, then uninstall them from the link there, and immediately check for these again and hide with the Hide Updates tool explained here: https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/223864\/how-to-uninsta...You can also go into Repair Mode by whichever method works here: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2294-advanc... to use the new Uninstall Updates button in Advanced Troubleshoot Options:https:\/\/pureinfotech.com\/uninstall-updates-adva....
