That means, that the audio is silent for about 1\/2 - 1 second. The game works fine, but the audio doesnt work in that moment. Audio means -> Audio of game, of my music, of everything I can hear.The problem occured, since I upgraded to the RTX 2080. (Used a 1080 before) But the card works fine, no problems at all with graphics or frame drops.\u00a0I used LatencyMon to get some information about the audio issue. Here is the result:_________________________________________________________________________________________________________CONCLUSION_________________________________________________________________________________________________________Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. Also one or more ISR routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup.

While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers. 2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/57567-resto... 3) Next try these checklists: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/402699... https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/443702\/how-to-fix-sou...4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps. If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby.5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button > Settings>Update & Security>Troubleshoot.6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button. Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

After re-install, I installed SP1. Then when trying to install SP2, the only option I had was to un-install it... the problem is I hadn't installed it yet. So I ran the un-install anyway and then re-installed SP2, successfully.\u00a0First problem: Throughout all this, I tried to enable the thrust reversers for jet aircraft. I think I remember that it is \"F2 \u00a0 throttle (decrease quickly)\"That didn't work well. It did on the very first attempt to use the reversers. Beyond that, the cones (A-321) hesitate to deploy, and vibrate. Beyond that, no reversers are available. So, thinking that my joystick (Logitech Extreme 3D Pro) was failing, I tried a different button assignment and the F2 key itself. Still no response. Then I remembered the SP2 problem. That is when I went along with the SP2 un-install and re-install. After this, the first attempt at using the reversers worked perfectly well. But subsequent attempts failed. No reversers.\u00a0Second problem: The throttle levers shake at any setting, but the engines run fine\u00a0 on MS planes like the A-321. I never had that problem before.The main reason why I un-installed FSX to begin with was a problem with and add-on, a gorgeous Il-76. When pulling the stick, the elevators didn't budge and the rudder turned instead. When twisting the stick, then the elevators worked, but not the rudder. On the Fly-Away website, there is no mention of this problem, except my own as yet unanswered question. On another plane, an An-124, pushing the throttle caused engine no. 2 to respond, ONLY. I have re-installed the An-124 and the throttles now work well, except for the shaking. The Ilyushin was the last one installed. But the other problems developed over that past couple of weeks. Before that, I had thrust reversers, and no aircraft gave signs of having Parkinson's Disease.Can someone please restore my sanity? Everything was fine until maybe 2 ~ 3 weeks ago. Then the problems started. There have been no changes to my PC for quite a while... One would think that a fresh install would fix such issues.Thanks,John","solutions":["\ud83d\ude2d\u00a0\u00a0\ud83d\ude4fWell, that is good news indeed.\u00a0\u00a0 Let\u2019s hope that it stays that way \u2013 at least you have a clean slate to work with for the future.\u00a0\u00a0 Though, I\u2019m still concerned with the Airbus and maybe your third party add ons.\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, all the best with it and for this year John.\u00a0 \u00a0Thanks for letting us know the outcome.Chris"]},{"symptom":"Program will no longer load        I have Windows 10.\u00a0 I've been using a software entitled QuiltPro for years.\u00a0 I've upgraded every time one is offered.\u00a0 My program worked fine until just recently.\u00a0 Now it simply will not open.\u00a0 I've uninstalled and reinstalled several times, but to no avail.\u00a0 The QuiltPro technical support suggests that it is a Windows 10 problem.\u00a0 I've updated Windows every time an update is offered.\u00a0 What am I doing wrong?","solutions":["Any 3rd party anti virus, security, cleanup programs ever installed on the computer?.What OS build are you on?\u00a0 Hit the Windows key, type winver, hit Enter.Or Windows key+r, winver, OK","I have a Norton paide subscription, free Malwarebytes, freeCCleanerMy OS build is 18363.535Thanks for any advice you can give.","Norton is not needed.\u00a0 Go to Norton and get their removal software.\u00a0 Programs and features uninstall does not remove all the code.Remove CCleaner also.","Thank you so much.\u00a0 I am hesitant to remove Norton, but I will remove CCleaner and Malwarebytes.","Hi pegmrow My name is Jon and I am an independent technical adviser.
