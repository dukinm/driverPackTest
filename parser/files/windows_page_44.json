I would like to multi-boot Windows 10 Pro with Ubuntu 18.04. It looks as if it is a simple matter of selecting the legacy section of the boot menu, but I would appreciate a response from someone who knows. and are there any issues with having to do other operations, additions or deletions?As always I very much appreciate any responses.Mike Bereece","solutions":["Hi Mike. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Using Legacy instead of the modern UEFI interface is like buying a new car and disabling all of the safety features. You can do it if you want but just be aware of the risks which are that it's much less secure.To do so choose CSM or Legacy BIOS (or disable UEFI) and boot the media as a plain and not UEFI device. Delete all partitions down to Unallocated space to clear formatting, then click Next to let it auto-create and format the needed partitions and begin - this makes it foolproof. Follow the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...

This appears to be a long and time consuming process, I should say that I am in my 70,s and not as sharp as I once was. However, I am retired, live alone and have little else to do.My current issue is that I want to have another copy of windows 10 Pro but in 32 Bit instead of 64 bit (I was a Lighting Designer when I worked and have some design software that will only run on a 32 bit platform). I had this multi-boot option on my old computer (and may still have it) but I cannot seem to get a 32 Bit Windows 10 installation to work (I got the 32 bit Windows 10 Pro version via the Media Creation Tool). I understand that the UEFI standard is not happy with 32 Bit.
