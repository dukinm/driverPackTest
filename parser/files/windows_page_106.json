Both Windows and TreeSize state that the allocated hard drive space is 2.8 GB, but the size is 9.5 TB.\u00a0 The reason for the high file size starts at a certain point in the folder (see screenshot):TreeSize provided information stating that the large files have way too little allocated on the hard drive (see screenshot):The file names are similar, so it is not a long file path issue. I have tried running the troubleshooter under administrator with no luck. I ran DISM.exe ... restorehealth in elevated CMD, still no luck. Since 1909 should have fixed this issue, I'm not sure what to do. I read that the metadata is the problem, but I don't know how to fix this.
