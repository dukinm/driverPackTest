I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.The app-ification of devices comes from Phones and Tablets, and since Microsoft wanted to broaden Windows to cover those Devices too, it decided to add an App Store just like Apple has on ALL of it's devices. If they didnt' they wouldn't be competitive and lag behind trends which are toward Apps. This is highly generational, as older users don't want or need Apps while younger ones expect them.So they provide a sampler of starter Apps with Windows 10, only some of which cannot be uninstalled in App Settings. If it doesn't have an Uninstall button there is this Uninstaller from MS TechNet that loads most of them and provides an Uninstaller script - set a Restore Point since there can be unintended consequences: https:\/\/gallery.technet.microsoft.com\/scriptcen...Or you can just ignore them.

Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... -------------------------------------------- But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues.

Step by step through every and all the recommended procedures offered by Microsoft.Two different Microsoft techs did a remote clean install to no effect.I strongly suspect a buggy (what else is new?) update is causing the problems since the headset worked fine for the first few months, and only recently have I had the long boot times and stop times issues. It still works fine when the OS remembers it's there.The sound still works through my TV monitor btw, just not through the headset, because the OS keeps dropping the USB Advanced Audio device randomly and just as randomly reacquires it.Which update do you recommend uninstalling?Like I stated in my first post: all drivers are up to date with the most recent available from the manufacturers.A decent OS offers a way for users to manually mount devices. Does Windows 10 allow such? If so, kindly explain the\u00a0 procedure.It's been ~3-5 weeks since the issues began.","Why would you think you could talk that way to me on Christmas eve when I took the time to explain that I had no way to know what all you'd done so I was going to give you all possible steps in case there were some you hadn't tried?No one else would pick up a thread like that because it's usually a sure thing we'll be abused if we suggest anything.\u00a0 But I decided to give you a chance.\u00a0 Sure enough.Notice how you reject ALL the steps without even noticing that one of them is how to roll back Updates, then you ask me if I think it might be Updates.\u00a0 Yes, that's why I gave you that step.Bye.","Sorry, but I, like many others, get frustrated at being told to do the same ineffective things over and over again.I did clearly state I have already done all recommended steps, several times.Rereading my post, I can see I offered no insult or abuse, just questioned whether you had actually read my post or just the title before you responded.I have uninstalled the last update, which is why I asked which one you recommended to uninstall.Your disdain for third party software doesn't help. The software comes highly recommended and is well thought of usually. Third party software is what makes using Windows tolerable.Microsoft has a very, very long history of buggy updates that they decline to accept responsibility for, usually blaming it on other products. It seems like most updates are required to fix bugs and holes presented by the last update.The issue is this: why does Windows 10 drop a particular sound device, while retaining others, only to reacquire it on its own sometimes? How does that happen?IS there a way for a user to manually mount that device?As I said in my reply, two different Microsoft technicians looked at my setup remotely and found nothing wrong, both reinstalled my OS, the first reinstall screwed up my computer, the second rolled it back to where it was before the first one messed it up, but neither solved the problem or offered any clue as to how to fix it.At that, the support was better than usual circular techbabble you get from them.","How would I know what \"recommended steps\" you've done unless you listed every last one of them?\u00a0 Obviously I don't even know one step you've done unless you list it.\u00a0 Mine are based on collecting everything that's worked for countless thousands of consumers I help in the forums, constantly adding to and subtracting from the list, adding recent issues that need to be checked, and known issues which change from month to month.\u00a0If third party software is what makes Windows 10 tolerable, why have none of the millions who have completed myClean Install Windows 10 , and stuck with only the recommended (Windows) tools and methods, ever come back to report another problem I've seen?If even one of them had added a third party tweaking suite I'd expect them to report back problems.This is not Support, this is a forums where peer users give their time to help others. \u00a0 I gave you a chance to cooperate, in spite of the warning signs in your first post that you were going to attack anything I said as having been on your imaginary forbidden list of things you'd already tried.\u00a0 So instead of continuing, it stops here.\u00a0 No one will help someone who is so uncooperative and just daring kind volunteers to suggest something they don't like.\u00a0 To do this on Christmas is intolerable.If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.\u00a0\u00a0 But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a\u00a0 tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.","Oh, the reason the troubleshooter doesn't do a thing is that it is functioning with the assumption that there is something wrong with the device, and the device itself is ok.The troubleshooter can't troubleshoot what isn't there.The problem originates at a higher level within the OS. Something,. some event, is dismounting that device. Something else within the OS then sees the device and remounts it...sometimes, but not always, I'd say perhaps 30% of the time.It stays for a bit then is lost again, and then the machine crashes. Not a blue screen crash, it freezes. When I pull up the task manager, it goes to a blank black screen if I am in a game, any game. I can still hit the Windows key and access the task bar, allowing a reboot from there, but attempts to close the game in question don't produce results unless I load the task manager several times and close it several times then the game quits and I get back to the desktop, but still without sound.It is definitely an OS problem so far as I can see, and not an uncommon one, as my researches have found innumerable complaints and pleas for help with the issue of Windows 10 losing sound, which means it keeps losing track of sound drivers.Microsoft needs to fix the problem with their junkware.","I told you how to report this to Microsoft.\u00a0 The Troubleshooter was only one step of dozens I gave including detailed tutorials with multiple steps.\u00a0 It might take a full day to actually do the steps given instead of outright reject them with the absurd claim you'd already done them all.\u00a0 Again, how would I know which ones you've done?I've helped more people in tech forums than anyone else on the web, daily for ten years.\u00a0\u00a0 When someone introduces himself telling us not to give any suggestions because they've already been tried, this is someone looking for trouble and not help.\u00a0 If you want help then perform all of the steps including in the tutorials and report back results for each.\u00a0","How rude.I told you this problem has been ongoing, and that I have done the all steps that Microsoft has officially listed (yes, there is an official Microsoft recommended list of fixes) to solve the problem over the past few weeks. I have also followed all the relevant procedures I could locate via forums and Windows troubleshooting websites.I HAVE reported this to Microsoft and worked with ~five different techs going through these steps you have recommended.You ask me to spend days reinstalling (which I've done twice already) and going through all the same steps that failed previously without once addressing the real problem:Why is Windows dropping the sound driver? How is it reacquiring it?Clearly for all your supposed expertise you have no idea of what is causing the problem. It's truly ok to say \"I don't know how to fix that\" rather than insult people seeking help.I don't mind if you don't reply, since you have nothing to offer but time-wasting \"fixes\" that have failed to work. Reinstalling everything is basically a nuclear option that says \"I don't know what the problem really is, but hopefully this will fix it\".I would much rather find and fix the specific issue with dropping sound drivers, which seems to plague Windows 10 users and has done from the earliest versions so far as I can tell.","Is this the list of Microsoft sound fixes list you're referring to:https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-in\/help\/4520288\/windows-10-fix-sound-problems ?\u00a0 It is the only MS published list I know of.It is one of 13 steps including eight other separate tutorials I gave you.\u00a0\u00a0 It is only a fraction of the fixes I gave which you dismissed as though I should know you've already tried them when you didn't even say what you've tried.\u00a0If this is the list you tried from MS, then you've not even begun on my list of fixes.If you've tried the Sound controller driver from the PC and adapter maker's Support downloads web page, then try uninstalling the driver, restart to see if that stabilizes it. Since there might be Display audio involved, uninstall all the Audio category drivers, restart the PC to reinstall. \u00a0If not try all older drivers in Device Manager > Sound controller > Browse > Let Me Pick.","And yes, I have done all of those...several times.Do you know the answer to these questions or not? It's fine to say no, ok?Why is Windows dropping the sound driver?What events can possibly trigger the loss?How is it reacquiring the driver on its own?Is there a way to manually mount the driver?"]},{"symptom":"file history?        how do I reconnect my file history?","solutions":["Hi Chaz.
