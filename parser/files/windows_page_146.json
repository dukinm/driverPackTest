I used my laptop to go to youtube, and as it was having a hard item loading, i used my main PCs option of \"troubleshoot network\" and the site loaded on the laptop.\"I should mention that i get the \"website cannot be reached\" or \"website has timed out\" error. As soon as i use the TN option, problem fixed for an undetermined\u00a0amount of time.The only other possible\u00a0thing it could be is maybe a bad wire somewhere, however if that was the case, every device on every OS would have the issue, but its only W10.","Which version of Windows 10 do you have on each affected device?","All my computers are on the latest release.","The latest release of what version?What OS build are you on?\u00a0 Hit the Windows key, type winver, hit Enter.Or Windows key+r, winver, OK","Sorry for not getting back to this post here, Ive tried more things.

For example, I'll open Chrome and start browsing. Initially the sites in Chrome will time out for about 45-60 seconds, then start working.Then, with Chrome working fine, I'll open Internet Explorer and get the same timeout issue for 45-60 seconds in IE. IE then works fine.I get the same timeout problem with Remote Desktop as well - 45-60 seconds before I can reach the remote computer. After that, no problem.So it doesn't matter that other processes are accessing the network just fine at that very moment. Every new process takes 45-60 seconds to get network access.The behavior isn't just happening to new processes. If a process has not accessed the network in a while, it will experience the timeouts again after being idle.I ran Wireshark to see what is happening in that initial timeout period. I see nothing going outbound to the target server in that time.I tried going to internal sites to eliminate firewall issues, and I tried entering IP addresses to eliminate DNS issues.
