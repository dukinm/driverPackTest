I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.Moving activation to new hardware depends on whether the original license is retail or OEM. This is because retail can always migrate wherever you want, but OEM dies with the first motherboard installed upon. Upgrades inherit these rights and restrictions.If it's retail and it shows a Digital License linked to your MS Account in Settings > Update & Security > Activation, then you can usually transfer the license by signing into the same MS Account on the new hardware, run the Activation Troubleshooter. See if it finds the old hardware and let's you move it to the new. If not you will need the retail key to reactivate via Support, so try inserting it first in Settings > Update & Security > Activation > Change Product Key even if it's the key for the old OS which was Upgraded.If not contact Microsoft Support by one of these phone numbers: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/405170...You can also go here: https:\/\/partner.support.services.microsoft.com\/... choose the link for Browser help, interact briefly about your exact problem until it connects with an agent.There is more on hardware changes in this Microsoft publication: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/20530\/...I hope this helps.

What can afford to move without any speed loss are your User folders. I will deal with this a bit later.I will give you steps to free up space on smaller drives and when necessary perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.First here are tips for managing smaller drives including the 32-gb SSD which they should have never allowed Windows 10 be installed upon:https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/technology\/askjack\/...https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3040404\/windows...https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/maximize-stora...As more space becomes needed, you can move your User folders to another internal hard drive you have or install, or Desktop, Documents and Pictures folders into OneDrive and then set them to On Demand so they reside in the cloud and only have download links on the PC: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/116029-turn...https:\/\/www.pcworld.com\/article\/3233488\/windows...You can also offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive you can install on the same PC (even in the DVD drive bay) as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/1964-move-u.... I would not move program files or speed will be affected. You could also install a larger SSD\/HDD.This should make enough space to install Windows Updates. But I'd focus on the latest Version update since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator. This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...
