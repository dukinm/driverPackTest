I'll do my best to help you with this.You aren't going to need to buy new license. Provided you had an activated version of Windows previously and install again with the same version (ie. Home or Pro) Windows will automatically re-activate as you are installing on the same hardware (even if you need to change the hard disc it still counts as the same hardware as the activation is tied to the mainboard).In order to get a reinstall going without loading Windows you need to boot the computer from your USB drive. Firstly, make sure you have the most recent Windows install media by visiting the official download website and building a new USB drive - hopefully you have another computer which this can be done with. The site is here: https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/software-downlo... In order to boot from the USB drive you can either press a key while the computer is preparing to load (the screen might prompt something like \"Press F12 to choose boot device\" or \"Press ESC for start-up options\", or similar) OR if you can still access the recovery options go to Troubleshoot section and choose to start the computer from a USB device.The aim here is to get the computer loading Windows set from the USB drive... doing it this way it doesn't matter if the HDD is corrupt, or even blank, set-up will load so you can make some progress.Once you get that going - I'd suggest trying the repair options first - as they might be able to recover your existing install however failing that you'll need to do a reinstall - this will move your files to c:\\windows.old (so you won't lose anything), but does mean you need to reinstall apps, etc, assuming you can get in to set-up choose a \"Custom\" install... if you're asked for a product key just SKIP that step, but be sure to choose either Home or Pro Windows the same as you had previously.Regards, David"]},{"symptom":"windows 10        Thank you to all who responded.i heard there is a free upgrade from Microsoft for Windows 10.\u00a0 is this true, if so how does one go about taking advantage of that freebie?","solutions":["i heard there is a free upgrade from Microsoft for Windows 10.\u00a0 is this true, if so how does one go about taking advantage of that freebie?Feature update to Windows 10 VersionMicrosoft\u00a0 .Net Framework 4.8 for Windows 10 Version 1809 for x64 (kb4486153)","Hi 99 The free upgrade period from Windows 7 and 8 to Windows 10 ended 3 years ago . . .That is the official word, however, a lot of users report they can download the Windows 10 ISO from the link below and that can be used to upgrade for free to Windows 10 still . . .https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-downlo..."]},{"symptom":"Update Issues After Installing Version 1903        After version 1903 finished installing(I put off updating for a long time), I went to see if there were more updates that I should install.

In the Mobile settings of Windows 10 I can see the Modem is there and connected to the Network (with a SIM card plugged in), but underneath the network name it is \"Turned Off\".I have tried clicking \"Cellular\" to \"turn on\" the modem and this does nothing.I have tried disabling the modem, re-enabling it, uninstalling it, reinstalling it. Nothing works - I am unable to get the Modem to \"turn on\".I have tried taking the modem and plugging it into a PC nearby that is still currently running Windows 10 Pro 1809 - and it works perfectly.I have also tried plugging this into 2 other PC's all running 1903 and they have the same issue. The modem is turned \"off\" and unable to turn on.Additionally, I have tried replacing the Sierra Wireless modem with one from another manufacturer, and I have the exact same issue. I cannot turn the modem on, yet I plug it into a PC running 1809 and everything is fine.I have tried running the network diagnostics, only to be told to use the function keys (they do not exist - this is a desktop PC and this is effectively a USB modem) - or to use a switch on my PC to turn it on (again, it does not exist).I would appreciate some help with this - google is failing me, and the closest I could find is someone having the exact same issue with an insider build:\u00a0https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/insider\/forum\/all\/mobile-broadband-capability-turned-off-and-there\/e695db5b-39a9-449a-a53b-ca3b1748d936\u00a0though this appeared to be fixed with a newer version?Thank you in advance for your help.","solutions":["I've seen this \"turn off\" thing. In my case, the Sierra drivers were not properly installed. And this was because at my work, we block executables running from the Temp folder.When we installed the driver package, it was done in two steps. First was the normal installer we're all used to. Then, a smaller, yellow rectangle popped up in the corner of the screen to \"configure\" the modem. If this yellow configuration box didn't pop up, the modem could not be turned on. When it did work, Windows changed \"turned off\" to \"Insert SIM\" or the carrier's name if we had a SIM in.I would also eliminate the adapter and connect the card to your motherboard, then reinstall the driver package.","Hi Liam My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows & Devices for IT MVP.

There should be no real difference between plugging it in via an adapter or plugging it into a Mini-PCIe port.I will try re-installing the sierra wireless drivers to see if I can see the yellow rectangle you mention and also try and use another adapter.It's odd that it works correctly with the exact same drivers on 1809, but not on any of our 1903 installs.Thanks for your help.","Hi,Thanks for the suggestion, unfortunately this did not work.I removed the drivers then installed with the compatibility settings for Windows 8, then Windows 7.","I have an update:We're now able to get the Sierra Wireless modem\u00a0to turn on by enabling Flight Mode, waiting until it is fully on (the icon is displayed and the tile has changed colour), then disabling Flight Mode, then clicking on the Mobile Tile. The downside of this is that even with an antenna connected and SIM card, the modem reports \"No Service\", even though moments before toggling Flight Mode, we were at full signal.There's not an issue with the SIM card. It has since been tested in other devices.We were also able to turn the modem \"on\" using Sierra's Skylight tool.However, we're unable to replicate the same workaround to get the modem to\u00a0turn on when using the Quectel modem.I'm convinced this is an issue with Windows 10 1903 rather than driver-specific issues.Thanks","I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers in my capacity as a Windows Insider MVP.https:\/\/windows10.help\/blogs\/entry\/54-how-to-su...The only likely option would be downgrade to a previous version such as Windows 10 1809.You can download it at: https:\/\/uupdump.ml\/selectedition.php?id=48dd563...Step 2: create a bootable copy https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wik...Step 3: perform a custom install http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/insider\/wiki...Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old: https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/for...Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1903 again.

Definitely a Microsoft update issue.","It's definitely a Windows issue, we're seeing the same issue with both Sierra Wireless modules and Quectel.We're in a bit of a panic mode at the moment, as I read a news article yesterday that Microsoft are forcing 1903 at minimum on all users at the end of this month, leap-frogging 1809, which is what we are currently using to get around this problem.Ideally we would be using an up-to-date version of windows, but compatibility is proving to be a huge issue with USB Modems at this point.","Hi Andre,Thanks for your post, apologies for taking so long to get back to you.I did submit a bug report within Windows itself, but no URL was offered to me. Is there another way of doing this?For now, we've had to keep with our 1809 install, but we've recently read that Microsoft are planning to force 1903 on all users due to 1803 being end-of-life and choosing to leap-frog 1809.This is a massive problem for us.Is there anyway to contact Microsoft directly for support with this issue?","This is a definite bug.\u00a0 We are having it with anything we update past 1809\u00a0 wich is sad."]},{"symptom":"Windows apps not working;: edge, wifi list, start menu, settings won't open        after the last update released in November.
