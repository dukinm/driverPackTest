One of his friends had access to a copy of Windows 10 Education, which he installed on the PC. After a little time, I realized while trying to personalize that Windows was, apparently, not activated. He claims that he had a key and got it activated. Unfortunately, my friend cannot get into contact with the person who did the install, so I have no way of getting this key from them, if they even still have it. My PC appears to have had the key at least attempted before.Over time, I have looked more into how I could fix the issue, and every time I came up empty. Finally, I'm sick of the setbacks to Windows not being activated (and the watermark on the screen that I have been trying to look past for a year now) and want to get to the bottom of this once-and-for-all. Coming up dry yet again on a search for solutions, I thought that maybe I should suck it up and purchase Windows 10 Home to install. However, I nearly gagged when I saw the price tag. That will require quite a bit of saving up.Just looking for ideas, suggestions, anything that may help before I give in to buying another copy of Windows in an attempt to fix this one.Thanks in advance.","solutions":["Hi Jesus, thanks for posting your question in the community!

Unless your PC has confirmed dead or dying hardware, then software can always be repaired or replaced, and if you've not done a Clean Install yet this is the opportunity to get the best possible install, one which has had no return problems by any of the millions who have tried it. Let's start at the top with all possible steps to get Windows started leading up to if necessary a Reset saving files or a Clean Install with file rescue.Unplug power and remove battery, press and hold power button for 30 seconds to release all power from circuitry, plug back in and power up to see if any change.I will give you steps to access the Repair Mode to try all repairs to get Windows started, and if not to do the automated Reset or the superior Clean Install after rescuing your files.1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/2294-advanc....

There is always a way to get the media booted and I will guide you until it does, even if necessary to reset the BIOS to defaults via several methods.3) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore to a point before the problems began, try the new Uninstall Updates button, then Startup Repair, then if necessary from Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking, or lastly Safe Mode. If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from the Command Prompt following Step 5 here:https:\/\/www.digitalcitizen.life\/4-ways-boot-saf..., or using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Boot Options here:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/22455-enabl... where you can also try the old reliable Last Known Good Configuration.4) From Safe Mode w\/Networking work through the Windows 10 Install Integrity Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki....

Since you change the file path by moving folders around a lot, this breaks the shortcuts as the file paths change.Maybe you should have a master folder which you don't move around and this holds the files you are creating shortcuts to?

Choose Settings. Select System. Select Display. Look for Scale and layout. Select an option, such as 125% or 150%.

The scale was 100%, I tried 105, 110, 90, and 95% but windows still shift from one screen to the other. For example if Firefox is on the external monitor and I open the laptop lid, Firefox jumps to the laptop. That is one of the least annoying but easily producible actions.","Hi, I'm an Independent Advisor and a Microsoft user like you. Please allow me to assist with your issue.There is two parts to your issue. 1. Your laptop's display power might be cut off when you close the lid. This basically detach the display on a physical level and there is nothing else you can do about it. The best way moving forward is to set your external display as the primary display.2. As you have experienced, Windows will turn off the built-in display when the lid is closed. This will move opened Applications to the external display. There is a hack by changing \"ACPI Lid\" to \"Volume Manager\" in Device Manager. See post here by yakup:https:\/\/forums.whirlpool.net.au\/archive\/1421975.

I figured this is because when you close the lid, all opened windows moved to secondary display and when lid is opened they all will move to the primary display.
