You can fix that by:First, you MUST have a real Win 10 license and a Microsoft account. Thats easy to create if you only have a local user.It will make your Win 10 into a digital license that you can link your new user\/machine too. And you never need to remember the license. Its your account.And, Microsoft is VERY good with YOUR security regarding Microsoft account. They really are.To fix issues like the store dont work, Win defender is wierd and many others, there is 3 things you can do before you do a clean install, and make a complete new user.First. Activate the win 10 administrator account. Log in that. Try the store.If it works then, than your user is most likely corrupt.I have 3 suggestions.\u00a0I would go with C.A. Make a new user. Must be administrator. Reboot. Then delete your old user.This works 100%, IF the issue is in your user, but you loose ALL settings, links and everything connected to your user. You need to reconnect to your Microsoft account, Office, google, etc.B. Same as A, but you copy FILES AND FOLDERS from your current user to the new one. NOT the whole thing.This way you keep links and licenses to games and software you dont have in steam, google, etc.HOWEVER, you may not fix the problem, because the issue could be in something you copy.C. Use a User cleaning tool.\u00a0WARNING! There is NO Microsoft supported tool that can do this.There are tools who claims they cleans users, but a vast majority of them are malware. And worst case, locks your computer and transfer your account to them. However, these are not common anymore since....well.....Microsoft have made one bloody good OS in win 10.\u00a0There is a tool I have tried and several good windows tech sites (non Microsoft) praise this tool.Its called\u00a0Account Profile FixerI tried this myself 2020-01-03. And have run it on 4 other corrupt users in real (friends)I ran it, 30 mins later, I had my PC back, INCLUDING a new user, but with the same name and links.I had to reconnect Outlook, My Microsoft Account, the Microsoft store and several applications.My dragon Chrome I uninstalled before the clean, and installed fresh, and synced back all my usernames and passwords.\u00a0(DONT SYNC GOOGLE ACCOUNT WITH SETTINGS AND APPS ON A PC IF YOU HAVE YOUR MOBILE CONNECTED TO IT!)It was a bit of hassle getting all my settings back. Pictures, background, theme.I did it all from scratch. I saved nothing in the cleaning, which I highly suggest no one else does.My PC runs faster, cleaner and all issues with microsoft store, windows firewall etc. Was gone.This is the link to the tool:https:\/\/www.carifred.com\/apf\/It is free, but so far got accepted by google.\u00a0However, Be CAREFUL with this!The tool itself means you no harm. But it has very little defense against getting altered since its created by a regular guy, who made it and let anyone who wants to, download it.But It works!Important: You get 2 choices when you run the tool about what you want to save. SAVE NOTHING.Its only settings, not licenses and the important stuff.Follow the instructions and be patient. And you have a repaired user, with your current name.Your computer will reboot several times, and you will need to make a new password for your \"new\" user, when its done.I am getting quite familiar using this tool now.I'd be happy to answer questions about it. Even though the ONE person who created it, supports it.I donated 50 bucks to him. Thats how much I liked this tool.Jonas The Swedish Goth","Hello, my name is Arif Ahmed, Windows Advisor.
