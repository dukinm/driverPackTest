If this is the wrong forum, please direct me to the right one, thanks!Hello!A few months ago I discovered that my desktop PC hasn't been updated since October 12, windows update gives a 0x80080005 error, and windows defender is nowhere to be found (the security window in settings is blank)You can read all about it here:\u00a0https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/all\/update-error-0x80080005\/ecb78662-9653-41a9-8062-438c4bb3470f?page=1Anyway, back then I came to the conclusion (together with someone from tech support chat) that I should just reinstall windows, but back then I couldn't do it because I was in the middle of an important project.Now that i'm towards the end of it, I can do it soon.So, which way you think is the best way to reinstall windows? because I noticed there are several - I think there are 2 options from the settings menu? and more if I download the tool from microsoft's site? and I understood there is a way to do it that lets me keep all my programs and drivers? (reinstalling them all will take time so if there's an option for that, which works good, i'd rather choose that)Which way would you recommend to reinstall windows?Thanks!\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0","solutions":["Hi, if you download that tool, you can create a Windows 10 ISO, then double click the ISO from inside File Explorer, and run setup.exe that will allow you to perform an in place upgrade, while keeping your files and apps, that would be the best method, because if you clean install Windows you would need to reinstall your applications","If you use the Media Creation Tool\u00a0http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-download\/windows10 you can create boot media (8GB USB) but in this instance just run it from your current install using File Explorer. This should update you to the latest version, 1909 by opening the USB drive and running setup.All files and programs will be kept and you will get confirmation about this during the update.As a note you should have a backup of your personal files just to be sure.","Hi, if you download that tool, you can create a Windows 10 ISO, then double click the ISO from inside File Explorer, and run setup.exe that will allow you to perform an in place upgrade, while keeping your files and apps, that would be the best method, because if you clean install Windows you would need to reinstall your applicationsThanks! (and also thank you neilpzz, I couldn't quote you here for some reason)I was asking because I understood that some people actually recommend a clean install? that choosing to keep programs and files may cause problems? anyway if that's legit then great.And obviously, i'll backup the important things.","Hi ItayO To be honest, a clean install is the best option, but you implied in your original post that you did not want to have to re-install all your software, so an in-place upgrade would be the next best optionIf it was me, I would go for the full clean install, yes that will take more time and all software would need to be re-installed and all your personalized settings would be lost, but that would result in a really clean and responsive operating system . . .","Hi ItayO To be honest, a clean install is the best option, but you implied in your original post that you did not want to have to re-install all your software, so an in-place upgrade would be the next best optionIf it was me, I would go for the full clean install, yes that will take more time and all software would need to be re-installed and all your personalized settings would be lost, but that would result in a really clean and responsive operating system . . .Got it.
