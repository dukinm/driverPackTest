I checked the Xbox One S (bluetooth) controller I have and THAT works. So this is strictly limited to the Xbox One wireless adapter no longer working with Windows 10.

I can't revert back, well aware of how system restore works, and the links posted under fixes for Xbox one controllers wasn't helpful at all. I quickly checked through them and nothing I haven't seen. I spent a good hour of troubleshooting and googling before posting here.

All those solutions are under the impression the controller doesn't work. IT DOES work, except it doesn't with ANYTHING from from the Microsoft Store. The controllers all work with everything else. This is an exception, not a general problem. The controller connects and works properly as it should. It shows up in Windows 10, it can be calibrated in Windows 10, I can use it to play Halo or Gears of War 5 on Steam. But launch ANY game downloaded from the Microsoft Store and it acts like there's nothing except the keyboard. THE ONLY controller that is working with the Microsoft Store downloads is the bluetooth controller.None of the information provided has a solution for a very odd specific problem. And most of those basic solutions like uninstalling, reinstalling, rebooting, etc, etc, I went through earlier in the day. For the record, I also tested this on my other PC and didn't run into the problem. I know as of early December I wasn't having these issues, and the only change between then and now was updating to 1909. Well, and buying Forza Horizon 3 last night which is why I'm aware of an issue with games from the Microsoft Store. However, seeing as the controllers and adapter work on the other PC, I can mostly rule out 1909 being at fault. Though i do see \"Your device is missing important security and quality fixes.\" under Windows Update, and checking for updates doesn't provide any update. Troubleshooting doesn't find any issues either.Side note, I meant no harm in marking the reply as not being the answer.","If the Xbox One wireless controller works in Xbox but is not working with any Microsoft Store games, then it could point to the drivers in Device Manager.Go into Device Manager, from View tab Show Hidden Devices, find the Xbox controller, first choose Update Driver, then Automatic.

Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.

Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.Another thing that might help as it solves many problems is to Upgrade to the latest version by installing the Media Creation Tool from this linkhttp:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.

I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems. What we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues.For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki.... It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy. So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.Until then you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

I am trying to add folders for recent months, which I am able to do. However when I try to rename the folder from \"New Folder\" to, say, \"2017-07 Vacation\" by the time I get to the \"V\" my whole folder rename resets and suddenly the name of the folder becomes \"V\" (wiping out my typing of \"2017-07 \") In order to accomplish what I want, I type just \"2017\" and hit enter, then go into rename and try to add \"-07\" before the reset happens and hit enter, then go into rename again and try to add \"Vacation\" before the reset. This takes several minutes.\u00a0I've done some research and have seen posts suggesting it is my screen background choices, but I have only a solid color, no refreshes.This did not happen in good old Windows 7. And this appears to be a problem for several years. Will some developer at Microsoft take a look and fix? Seems like it would be easy to fix. You can use my system to debug lol.Hoping I don't get the pat answers from other posts.If this won't be fixed, does anyone have a suggestion for a program other than file explorer that does not have this issue?thanks for any help or advice.","solutions":["Post your problem in Feedback for the Microsoft engineers to see.","Hi mrsraben and thanks for reaching out.
