You can reset your router back to factory defaults by using a straightened paper clip.\u00a0 Press it into the tiny hole in the back that says reset while the router is powered up.\u00a0 Hold that pin there for at least 15 seconds.Many routers then have a user id of admin and no password.Do not get carried away with WiFi security.\u00a0 It can not be accessed from any point much further than about 50 feet.\u00a0 Write the key you create on a sticker and put it on the router or modem.There is a type of technology that few will tell you about that can make a huge difference for this type of problem.\u00a0 It amazes me that more people, even technical people, are not aware of it.\u00a0 It is actually in some routers and notebook PC radios and the sellers don\u2019t even know it.\u00a0 It is called MIMO, which stands for Multiple In Multiple Out.\u00a0 It is supported by n radios, and will be used provided both the sending and receiving devices are capable.\u00a0 It works by transmitting on 2 or more closely adjacent band widths simultaneously.\u00a0 If a packet of information is lost or garbled, MIMO attempts to find a better copy of the packet from the adjacent stream, and is usually successful.\u00a0 Obviously 3\u00d73 MIMO systems are better than 2\u00d72.If you buy a new router, you should insist it has MIMO and you may have to do a lot of research to find which ones have it.\u00a0 More than you might think, but their sellers don\u2019t know about it.Wireless\u00a0n\u00a0devices (both router and the radio in your computer) are much better capable of handling this interference.\u00a0 Check to see if your router supports n and that it is set up to run on n if your devices talk to it on n.\u00a0 You will need help from your ISP (Internet Service Provider for this).You should\u00a0not\u00a0have more than one wireless router in a network or even try to connect one to another.\u00a0 In some wireless routers there is the capability of shutting down the router function and having them operate as wireless access points which acts like a signal repeater.\u00a0 In that case the wireless access point wirelessly connects to the main wireless router and has the network key (password)\u00a0to itPlacement of the wireless router can be very much the cause.\u00a0 It should ideally be near the centre of a building.\u00a0 It should be high in a room not down low to the floor where it can pick up more interference.\u00a0 Not near a wall or other electronic device.\u00a0 Sometimes just moving a router a foot or two can make a huge difference.\u00a0 Likewise the way antennas are pointed, assuming your router has one or more\u00a0externally"]},{"symptom":"You have been denied permission to access this folder        Hello!
