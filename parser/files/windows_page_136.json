Unable to Find Boot Device        I have already attempted multiple fixes and keep finding new errors that send me into rabbit holes.- I have made a USB bootable drive for Windows 10 and run the automatic repair on the drive it returns an error code 00xc0000098- I then attempted to restore the MBR with bootrec cmd manually, and it gives me an access denied message when running the \/fixboot cmd.\u00a0- To get the access denied error getting out of my way, I ran the diskpart in the cmd prompt.

I am completely lost on what to do next other than reinstall windows.","solutions":["Hi, I'm David an independent advisor and user just like you. I'll do my best to help you with this.It does sound like there could be a fault with your hard disc. If DISKPART cannot see any partitions, and you are unable to create a partition it doesn't sound good.The next think to try would be to use your bootable USB install media and attempt a reinstall of Windows - if that install thinks there are no partitions on your drive you have little option but to ask it to proceed and attempt to make one. It sounds like any data that was on the drive is already lost. If Windows will not reinstall it would be likely your hard disc is faulty. You can test your hard drive by using the free SeaTools app from Segate (even if it's not a Seagate drive). You can make a bootable USB drive to do this, or remove the HDD and conenct it as a second drive on another system to run the checks.

For NVIDIA cards:So, after a long time with this problem, trying several procedures, hopeless and annoyed, I found the solution, at least worked for me.The problem can be with factory\/manually overclocked cards, according with NVIDIA.Simply go to NVIDIA Control Panel > Help > and check theDebug Mode. (that will set the default clock speeds to the NVIDIA reference clock speeds). And that's it! It seems like you have to do this every time that you boot your PC.I already sent a bug report on the same day that I found this solution. In fact, this solution is writen in the bug report formulary as a possible fix. I told NVIDIA to fix this and if it's a Windows problem, then they can let Microsoft know about this.If you don't have a NVIDIA card, try to lower the clock speeds of your card with MSI Afterburner, I don't have much knowledge on this matter but I guess you can lower the memory clock and core clock speeds. Do 50MHz and then test whatever game that you are having this issue, if didn't solve then lower by another 50MHz and so on (50MHz it's a example, you can lower 10, 20, 30 etc). It's best if you can do some research before messing with the clock speeds, but the important thing is that the problem can be related to the clock speeds.THERE YOU GO, LET ME KNOW IF THAT HELPED!","solutions":["Replying to my own thread to help xD","This issue it's really annoying so another post to keep it up '-'\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0","Up!....","I would like to help this many people that were left without a solution:https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/search\/search?SearchTerm=aplication+has+been+blocked+from+acessing+the+graphics+hardware&IsSuggestedTerm=false&tab=&isFilterExpanded=false&CurrentScope.ForumName=windows&CurrentScope.Filter=windows_10-hardware&ContentTypeScope=#\/windows\/windows_10-hardware\/\/1But sadly the topics are locked.","Updated description.","UP......","Let's go, another up! xD","Thanks for this.

I'll do my best to help you with this.The official answer is that you can't. As the product key is on a sticker on the bottom of the computer that means it's an OEM key - that is one supplied with the laptop, and that cannot be moved to a new computer as it was only licensed for that particular machine. However - you say the sticker on the case is for Windows 7 Pro, but the laptop has Windows 10 Home installed? Did you purchase Windows 10 Home at some point? If so that would possibily be a Retail version which CAN transfer to a new computer - but you'd need some details, such as product key which would have been supplied when you purchased.It might be possible to use your Windows 7 Pro product key to install Windows 10 Pro on your new computer - the code will be accepted and might activate. But this would be in violation of the license for that software (as it was only intended to run on your old laptop) Regards, David","Im not sure if it was upgraded to windows 10 Home or Pro but we never payed for either, it had said that the laptop could be upgraded as a pop up box and when i did it, it never cost us anything more","The free upgrade would keep the version the same - so Windows 7 Pro would go to Windows 10 Pro, and Home to Home.If the sticker on the bottom of the laptop says \"Windows 7 Pro\" that would have been the version of Windows it was supplied with.As I said - you could try installing Windows 10 Pro on your new device and use the code from the bottom of the old laptop - while it might work, it's not strictly correctly licensed!"]},{"symptom":"Blue Screen, not sure what prompted it.
