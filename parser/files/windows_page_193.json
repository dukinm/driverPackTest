I cannot change the setting on the printer. Information says to change through Windows but I'm not sure where or how to do that. I'm not great with computer stuff..... Thanks!","solutions":["Hi Cori. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Moderator here to help you.These settings will be in the full printer software, accessed by opening it from the Apps list in Start Menu. If not there type Printer in Search box, open Printers & Scanners, click on the printer, then Manage, then Printer Properties to scour each tab for the setting needed. Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Install the printer which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:1) Power up the printer, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC. 2) Go to Settings>Apps>Apps and Features to find and Uninstall any printer software.3) Use one of these methods to remove all of the old printer drivers: https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/101274-unin...https:\/\/helpdeskgeek.com\/how-to\/remove-uninstal...4) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View. In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click printer to delete Printer and any scanner or fax of the same name. Restart PC.5) Go to the printer model\u2019s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package. Now is also the time to check for any newer printer firmware to install which matters a lot.6) Extract Printer software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator. Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software. For USB it should prompt when to plug in the printer.Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly: https:\/\/www.groovypost.com\/howto\/run-old-softwa... If you have further problems reply back with results of each step. Once it's installed and you've run a test print, then scanned it to see that it opens on the desktop, open the Printer software and go into its Settings to set the scan-to file location you prefer, also the email app you want opened for Scan to Email, if applicable.I hope this helps.
