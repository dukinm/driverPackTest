It will then reboot and direct you to the windows recovery environment.Another alternative is, Start your computer, once the computer goes to the windows logo screen press and hold the power button for 5-10 seconds to shut it down completely. Do this for 3-5 times to force access the recovery environment.a) Reset this PC Normally, you'd be given 2 options here. The first one is to keep your files although this process would ask for your password.

There's no password on the lock screen - the password is on the login screen.You will never read anything from Microsoft that says it's okay for a user to run their computer without a password-protected account. So if eliminating password protection is your goal ... good luck.The BIOS is not the place where you create and delete user accounts.There's no such thing as a WiFi cloud. WiFi and the cloud are separate things. WiFi is a local network technology. The cloud is a colloquial name for the internet.If I were you I would stop now and have a professional fix the computer.

Please don't ever share product keys online, they are personal to you and you risk your software license being stolen by posting them. No matter how old the key might be, they are almost always single-use.Currently the game is only officially available via Steam. As the code isn't registered as a steam product it can't be used to activate it. Unless you have another device with a disc drive you can copy the files on the disc from. I don't think you will be able to run it without buying the game again, as the original version is no longer available. And wasn't made available for download previously.I hope that helps.","You won't be able to get a download version of this game using a disc key. There are a small number of disc based games thatused GFWL that can be redeemed on Steam or the developers site, but this game does not apply to that exception.- Yes, do delete the key as best practice, but you won't need to worry about the key for a game of this vintage being single use.- What you can do if you have access to a machine with a CD\\DVD drive, is install the game on that machine and then copy\\paste itto your laptop. This often works with old games of this vintage.
