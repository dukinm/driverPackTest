These work for almost everyone else.If so then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m....","Hello!Thanks a lot for your help...yes, I did try all of the steps to fix night light in my post above.I am gonna try your second solution now...I have found that the problem is solved when I restart my laptop, sign out and also when I turn off \"turn on fast startup (recommended)\". hope this information helps you to find a proper solution for my issue.","Thanks for updating that problem is solved by turning off Fast Startup.

Samsung even advised me against switching out of S mode.\u00a0In fact, I'll be completely honest and inform you that I did make the switch and did in fact have some unforeseen complications. For starters my security settings are changed. Virus and threat protection are turned off and Microsoft store is no where to be found.
