Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.

I'm somewhat of a gamer, so when one of my favorites ceased to properly function, naturally I was distraught and went searching for answers. All of the solutions I was able to find online produced inconclusive results. Left with very few options, I made an executive decision to just reset my PC and start over. Yet again, I was met with disappointment. Everything seemed fine up until I was brought to the final stage of the process; resetting at the Alienware load screen, the process would fail and cancel itself out somewhere between 25 and 33 percent. Yet again I went online searching for answers and yet again I found nothing that helped, so I came here.
