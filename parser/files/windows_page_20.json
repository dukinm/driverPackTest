And I used to do this every week. It's no exaggeration to say that I spent more time maintaining my computer than actually using it. Very little of that obsession remains. (I'll tell you what remains later.) Let's go over some of what I used to do, and I'll explain why it's not necessary.RAM: I used to run Memtest64 - a popular memory tester. Today's RAM is so reliable and sophisticated that the chances of coming across defective RAM modules are less than negligable.Hard Drive:\u00a0 I used to defrag the c**p out of my hard drive until my Diskeeper interface looked like a stack of colored Legos. Even then all that defragging was unnecessary, and I definitely spent more time defragging that I could possibly save over the drive's lifetime by doing that much defrag.Today's HDD hardware is much more robust than in earlier HDDs and the firmware is much more sophisticated. Years ago PC professionals started discussing whether defragmentation was needed at all. Today we know that defragging beyond what little Windows does on its own is completely unneeded.For the same reason, there's no need to run CHKDSK or any of the other 'disk health' utilities that are still being marketed today.SSDs, of course, work completely different from HDDs, so none of the HDD procedures apply. Defragging, in particular, is an excellent way to shorten the life of an SSD.For years, HDDs and SSDs have been shipping with an industry standard utility called S.M.A.R.T. which continuously monitors the drive for signs of impending trouble. S.M.A.R.T. will alert you in the very unlikely situation that your drive may have a problem.Clearing caches: A cache, by that name or any other name, is simply a place where files created for temporary use are stored. After their temporary need is fulfilled, they are useless. Like empty drinking cups. They do absolutely no harm to your computer. Sure, they occupy space on your hard drive, but it would take many years of accumulation before you run out of drive space due to caches. And since Windows clears caches on its own, you'll never get to that point anyway.From time to time, you may need to clear your web browser's cache - but that isn't a maintenance procedure. Since browsers check their caches for web content to avoid downloading the same thing twice, you'd clear that cache if you\u00a0want your web browser to get a new copy of the page.And that was only the tip of iceberg for me. I was just getting warm.If there was ever a time when all that maintenance was a good idea, that time has long gone. For today, here's the unvarnished, unpleasant truth: There are people who still haven't learned how to operate their computers correctly, so they cause themselves all kinds of trouble. Instead of learning how to use their computers, they run to fixit\/cleaner\/optimizer utilities, which won't save them from themselves and are only likely to make a bad situation worse.So what's my remaining obsession? I still like to have only the absolute bare minimum of software that starts with Windows. Here's my Startup tab from Task Manager:","Many thanks for that concise account.Quite refreshing.My\u00a0suspicions were very much in line with you but I just hadn't had the confidence to believe this was the way with modern computers.I do clear my browser history on exit by default - ensuring that any useful\u00a0links\/information I want is\u00a0 added to favourites.","Please remember that a computer is not a human, and doesn't need the same kind of maintenance as a human.A human benefits from regular washing and shampooing - not a computer.A human works faster with less to carry around - not a computer.To wean yourself off registry cleaners in a hurry, try this experiment:Install a brand new, fresh, untouched copy of Windows is a virtual machine.Run your favorite registry cleaner on that copy of Windows.Look at all those 'errors' that the registry cleaner found! How dare Microsoft include so many errors in abrand new copy of Windows!Now restore that same, brand new, pristine copy of Windows in the virtual machine, and run adifferent registry cleaner on Windows.

How can that be? Should you perhaps try a third registry cleaner as a tie-breaker?On the other hand, if these registry cleaner companies are so smart - smarter than Microsoft, it seems - why don't they write their own registries for us to install? Heck, they should write their own operating system. Or maybe Microsoft should hire their developers for big bucks to 'fix' Windows and put the registry cleaning industry out of business.Or maybe there's something about registry cleaners that is fundamentally wrong?"]},{"symptom":"Windows infinite restart        My windows pc has been having some trouble recently... i am unsure of the cause but its been causing problems from, only booting to the bios, random freezing for two to three minutes and now my pc is stuck on the restart screen.

This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... 5) If these all fail to correct the problem then it may be caused by boot level code only corrected by wiping the hard drive with Diskpart Clean Command when doing a Clean Install:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/tutorials\/85819-erase...http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki...You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.

I'll do my best to help you with this.Windows 10 comes with a great many drivers built-in to the install file - and in the majority of cases will identify and install your network card driver automatically. However it sounds like, for whatever reason, it hasn't been able to identify your network driver in this case. If you were to look in Device Manager (right-click START, choose Device Manager) you might find you have one or more \"unknown\" devices listed - one of which will likely be your network device.There are a couple of options: 1. If the computer is a custom-build gaming type machine you might have some original installation CDs - if you have one for your motherboard it will contain drivers for your network device.2. If you know the make\/model of your mainboard and you can use a different computer to download the required drivers to a USB device and then install them on the problem PC.3. Get a USB plug-in network adapter - generally these either come with a built-in driver so work automatically or will have their own driver CD you'd need to install. that would get you online.

On your laptop, you can open Remote Desktop Connections to connect. Source: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-ca\/help\/402837... If you are using the internet, the difficulty will be making sure you have the IP address of your work desktop, and that if it changes, you note the new address for making these remote connections. You also need to consider any firewalls that may block the connections, and encrypting the connection if you are working with sensitive data.There are some third-party software options that make remote access a bit easier since they are an intermediary that connect to both devices, for example TeamViewer which offers a free version for personal use:https:\/\/www.teamviewer.com\/en\/credentials\/free-...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.

The file sharing protocol used for network file sharing (SMB) is highly insecure and not recommended for over-the-internet use without encryption. Some internet service providers block this port as it can be exploited to spread malware. Business typically use a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to share files over the internet.I would suggest that if you or someone at your work does not have the expertise to set this up, that you explore using a service like OneDrive to put this folder on, and the files will then be available from wherever you have an internet connection, and in a secure manner. Is there something specific you do not like about OneDrive? There is a desktop app to allow the files to sync to the local machine, and it is also accessible over a website interface.-Ashton","Ashton,Initially that is what I was going to do, use OneDrive however, then I found out that I could not save and use QuickBooks file to a virtual drive so that kind of messed things up for my plan.In the office, we just plug out pc's into the same router and make the connection and no problems however, if I want to access my files (specifically quickbooks) while on the road, it's a problem.\u00a0So I checked with quickbooks and they suggest QuickBooks online, which is their web based solution but, I already own and just upgraded to latest version. Also, I didn't want to be dependant on a life long subscription to quickbooks just to access my financial information.\u00a0The other issue I have is sync on OneDrive - if I setup my desktop to use OneDrive under my MS account, it sync's everything in my OneDrive folder (as it should) however, if I log into my MS account with my laptop on the road, it also sync's everything in the local OneDrive folder on the laptop.\u00a0 Since the desktop has to be on in order for me to access files remotely, I worry that making changes on the laptop with trickle over to the desktop prematurely. This might be a problem but, I haven't tried it yet.\u00a0Pete","Hi Pete, Thanks for this extra information. Yes, OneDrive will sync most folders unless you exclude them manually. This article describes the process on how to select the folders:https:\/\/support.office.com\/en-us\/article\/choose... I am not sure on QuickBooks itself (and I did search around and find that there is trouble using it on cloud services such as OneDrive) but I am out of ideas on this one - hopefully another expert will chime in with some other suggestions!Best wishes, -Ashton"]},{"symptom":"Games        How do I get Premier Solitaire?","solutions":["Hi Marcella.

They are not always the same exception. I have created a compressed folder of the minidumps I found and was hoping for some help.Here is the link to the OneDrive that contains these minidumps.https:\/\/1drv.ms\/u\/s!AiqaycZ9KqUcoDZMQnvY6LVKLTeX?e=ZROphS","solutions":["Hello TommyPham7! My name is Marco, I am an Independent Advisor. I will do my best to help you.Here are the 2 errors mentioned in the DUMP files. SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION (fltmgr.sys) And MEMORY_MANAGEMENT Which suggests that your memory is causing problems. It can be as much hardware as software.First, scan for malware, it can be the cause of these frequent BSODs. Here are 2 reliable and free antimalware.AdwCleaner : https:\/\/www.malwarebytes.com\/adwcleaner\/ Malwarebytes : https:\/\/malwarebytes.com\/ If nothing has changed ... try these basic steps. 1] Run Windows Update Since the source of this fltmgr.sys file is Microsoft; you might want to run Windows Update and see if it resolves the issue.2] Run sfc\/scannow Now, press WINKEY + X button combo or right-click on the Start button and click onCommand Prompt (Admin) or just search for cmd in the Cortana search box, right click on the Command Prompt icon and click onRun as Administrator. Click on Yes for the UAC or User Account Control prompt that you get. Then, the Command Prompt window will finally be open.After that, type in the following command: sfc \/scannow And then hit Enter. Let it scan the whole drive for any errors and then Reboot your computer to check if it has fixed the Blue Screen of Death Error.3] Checking hardware for physical issues Sometimes, faulty hardware can also result in the software driver not working properly. We would recommend checking the internal components of the CPU for any issues. These issues are not only caused when the device encounters physical damage but can also be caused due to voltage fluctuations and short circuits. You may also want to run ChkDsk. You could run a command like the following to check and repair disk errors on your C drive:chkdsk c: \/f \/r 4] Run the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool. Click on Start, type in mdsched.exe and allow the tool to check your computer memory (RAM) for problems.5] Update your BIOS and drivers. BIOS updates can be found on your manufacturer\u2019s website, and driver updates can either be done manually through Device Manager (use Start Search to find it)6] If on a laptop, change power settings to High Performance. 7] If this problem occurs shortly after installing a new program, remove that program right away.Give me news. ;-) Marco _________________________________________________ Note: Il y a des liens vers des sites Web autres que Microsoft.
