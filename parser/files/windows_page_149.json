(Download #100295)It did not fix the issue.My main reason for hesitating on the \"create new user account\" option is that I'm not entirely clear on the consequences and end result of that option.That is, if my ultimate goal is to basically have everything the way it is now (but with Search working), what will it take to get there from \"new user\"?\u00a0 Will I have to reinstall anything?\u00a0 Will some of my programs forget their settings and history?\u00a0 Will my customization and personalization settings be lost?","First of all it is for troubleshooting.
