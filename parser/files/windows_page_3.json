I have\u00a0 the same problem on three different laptops, starting from a recent Windows update, probably 1903. The issue does not refer to malfunctioning of a driver, it is a separate setup of the brightness level for battery operations which has been recently deleted in Windows. In details: it was\u00a0 possible to easily setup a different brightness level of the display when the laptop was on battery (eg. 80%) and when plugged in (e.g. 90%), for example just through the brightness slider in the\u00a0 Action Center. Once the laptop was on battery,\u00a0 reducing the brightness level to (e.g). 80% in the slider of the Action Center was remembered by Windows, so that each time the laptop was unplugged the display brightness was automatically dimming the brightness level (in my example to 80%) . Now the user has to re-set the brightness level manually each time the laptop goes on battery, if the user wants to dim the brightness level when on battery.The problem is that there is no longer a dedicated set up of the display brightness for battery operations, and the specific setups still present in BIOS are overridden by Windows as soon as the brightness level is changed.Reinstating the old feature will\u00a0 improve the battery runtime of laptops. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0"]},{"symptom":"Epson scanner will not work with latest windows 10 update        My epson perfection v700 scanner (that allows me to scan photos, negatives, documents, etc.) and that I paid over $800 for) stopped working with teh latest update two days ago.

I have tried to use the Registry Editor, setting everything up (yes, even made a back up) to allow me full 100% unrestricted access to everything (that isn't \"protected\" like AntiVirus or certain Windows shells) and that works. I can edit just about anything that I would to edit. It isn't perfect, but any control is better than none that Windows comes standard with.

I can access the file log by myself just fine, Windows appears to have \"Read Only\" unselected on the actual .pak file and the .dll files that I need access toyet every other folder still have the \"Read Only\" box darkened, including the folder that holds the files I need to have LOOT access.From my understanding of how Windows operates, the dark box (not the check mark) indicates that there is something within that folder that is \"Read Only.\" Yet within that same folder, if I check each folder and file within those, every last one has \"Read Only\" unchecked. So, either Windows is locking \"Read Only\" even though I have full rights according to Windows, or Windows has files that are \"hidden\" even though I have \"Show Hidden Files and Folder\" activated by default through Registry Editor. I have it done through Registry Editor because I've found that after updating Windows many things (like hidden folders and files and many of my individual folder and file settings) resets.
