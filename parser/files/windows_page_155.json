I recently got a new keyboard (Razer Huntsman Elite) and installed the drivers correctly (I think?). Along with it I got the software Synapse 3 to control certain aspects. It seemingly conflicted with other programs so I uninstalled it. However, this did not solve the issue as my computer is still crashing. I looked up some of the codes (they seem to always be different) and it may be related to the drivers? I would greatly appreciate help on this issue! I have attached the minidump file below.

Sorry to hear you are experiencing issues and I would really like to help you find a resolution.1. Try disabling windows smart screen? Locate the file you want to run or install, right-click on it, and select Properties.Locate the checkbox next to \u201cUnblock\u201d and check it. This should bypass SmartScreen since we have marked this file as safe. Try running the file now. If the issue persists, you might want to consider disabling Windows SmartScreen briefly in order to run the file. Please re-enable it again or you risk exposing your Windows PC to malware.Open Windows Defender Security Center by searching for it or by right-clicking on the shield icon in the right part of your taskbar and selecting \u201cOpen\u201d.Expand the menu on the right by clicking on top of it and open \u201cApp and browser control\u201d.Locate the \u201cCheck apps and files\u201d section and turn it Off. Try running the file now. 2. Try running the File via Command Prompt First of all, locate the problematic file, right-click on it, and select Properties.Copy the full location of the file. After that, run Command Prompt with admin rights by right-clicking on it and selecting this option.Paste the location of your file and add the name of the file with .exe at the end.Click Enter and check to see whether it will run. 3. Try disabling Antivirus If you are using a third party Antivirus on your computer it is possible that it might be blocking you from accessing the files and the \u201cAn Administrator has Blocked you from running this app\u201d error message might be triggered. Therefore, it is recommended to disable the Antivirus installed on your computer and check to see if the issue goes away. If it does, add an exception for the application that you are trying to run or keep the Antivirus disabled.For Disabling Right\u2013click on the \u201cAntivirus\u201d icon in the system tray. In most antivirus software there is an option to disable the antivirus from thereIf no option is available, search the web for the directions to disable your antivirus.Adding an Exception Open the Antivirus software and click on the \u201cScan\u201d option. Click on the \u201cAdd an Exception\u201d option and select the \u201cAdd Folder\u201d option. Select the folder in which the application has been installed. Try to run the application and check to see if the issue persists. Hope this helps.","Hi Mark,\u00a0Your questions:1. Is this a domain joined or workgroup PC?\u00a0It is a workgroup.2.
