Regards, Ross","Hi Ross,I guess you missed where I posted this in my original post -\"What I have read says to left click on a person\/email in the reading pane of an email. When I do that a window opens with the option of emailing back to that person and it shows a list of the emails that person has sent me\".I am clicking in the reading pane and I get what I explained above. This function doesn't appear to work for me.Pete","Hi,Sorry I probably didn\u2019t explain that as clearly as I could.There should be a save button at the top right of that pop-up that says save.Regards,Ross","The little icon in the upper right of my popup box is an email icon. Clicking on that opens a new email to that address.\u00a0There is no box, icon, or option to save the contact. I have tried everything including left and right clicking.\u00a0Pete","My kids would say I am old school - guilty!Unfortunately, that's a kiss of death in today's technology.Whether we like it or not, technology changes very quickly nowadays, because that's how the majority of people want it to be. We all need to learn to accept change on a regular basis. If you don't like change, you'll like irrelevance even less.","And exactly how does that help with my immediate issue? The fact that Microsoft configured their new OS so it\u2019s not possible to easily transfer existing contacts from the old is not my fault. I have made the progression from DOS through every public release of Windows and never had this issue before. I, like many others, will change as needed. But I don\u2019t appreciate being forced into it.\u00a0","And exactly how does that help with my immediate issue? ...But I don\u2019t appreciate being forced into it.\u00a0As I explained in my first reply, Windows Mail is only an interface to your webmail providers. It's very basic software.If you want to add someone to your contacts from an email, and have it work every time, you should be using the original webmail provider, which will make the process pretty much effortless.Unfortunately, we can no longer accept new technology on our own schedule. Microsoft learned that lesson the hard way, which is why there are no new Windows phones, among other examples.","Hi Pete, I've attached a thread where the user is having the same issue, also a screenshot of where the button should be:https:\/\/www.tenforums.com\/browsers-email\/49266-...Regards, Ross Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.
