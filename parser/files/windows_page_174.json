Thanks to everyone who helped, MVPS: Saltgrass and SumitEND SOLUTIONHello Everyone,I am currently trying to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7 Pro but unfortunately, the upgrade, using the Windows 10 installation media, keeps failing after the first restart, right after theinstall gets to around 27-31% completed.Windows 10 installation media I am using: https:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/en-us\/software-download\/windows10The error that pops up when it does fail after the first restart is: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLEDWith error code: 0xC1900101 - 0x30017After some digging about the error code, it appears that it is related to therebeing a bad driver somewhere but it doesn't tell me which one.Found here: https:\/\/docs.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/deployment\/upgrade\/resolution-procedures#0xc1900101After that, it boot loops twice and reverts the hard drive to just before starting the upgrade.Here is everything I have tried to fix it:Updated every single driver on my computer to its most recent version, yes all of them.I have made sure that I have absolutely every windows update for windows 7 to date, running windows update now only returns Windows is up to date.Initiated the upgrade will all external hardware unplugged, so literally just my laptop with an ethernet cable plugged inDeactivated Anti-virusAttempted the upgrade from a clean boot (Following this guide for Windows 7: https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-us\/help\/929135\/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows)I have run sfc \/scannow and chkdsk \/r several times over at this point, both show no errorsI have also cloned my hard drive to a spare SSD I had and booted of that to see if maybe my hard drive was failing and retried all of the above again but it still failed.I have also followed the following steps to try and repair windows update but that doesn't appear to be an issue:net stop wuauserv net stop cryptSvc net stop bits net stop msiserver Ren C:\\Windows\\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old Ren C:\\Windows\\System32\\catroot2 Catroot2.old net start wuauserv net start cryptSvc net start bits net start msiserver RestartI am stuck here, I am not sure what else I can to do to get this upgrade to work. My searching throughout the web has led me to this point trying the above.The only other more extreme solution I found was someone stating that once the upgrade performs its first restart, is to hard shutdown the machine yourself (hold down the power button) and then start it back up. I am not so sure about this as I think this is very likely to cause some sort of drive corruption for sure.Found here: https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/all\/error-0xc1900101-0x30017\/16817841-15d1-4487-a646-13cd9b116961?page=1Any and all help is greatly appreciated, thank you.","solutions":["Yes, you should try to disable it first and attempt the upgrade.
