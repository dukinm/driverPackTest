for decades, but have since changed.\u00a0 Most of the other advisers in this forum and most of my colleagues will disagree with me, some vehemently.I would appreciate your reading my Profile which you can find by clicking on the CT icon.\u00a0 I am a very knowledgeable expert with over 50 years of experience in the field.\u00a0 I have been a contributor to thousands of questions in this forum for 10 years now.I look after 120 windows 7 client machines and have for many years.\u00a0 I was one of those people who believed the sky would fall if I did not apply updates regularly.\u00a0 About 5 years ago, Microsoft started using WU (Windows Update) for much more than what it had been for a few decades -- a security system.\u00a0 At that same time (which coincides with the end of Windows 7 development), Microsoft fired its entire Quality Control staff that looked after WU's.\u00a0 Ever since then WU has become almost a comedy of errors.\u00a0 Actually bricking millions of machines.\u00a0 A related fact is that Windows 10 by design allows no choice on WU.\u00a0 It just does it when it dam well feels like it.At the beginning of 2015, Microsoft started using WU to push \"updates\" that would force its customers computers to become more useful to Microsoft.\u00a0 Many, including me, resisted that because Windows 7's design allows you to decide what updates to use and when.\u00a0 Then about 4 years ago, Microsoft changed the structure of WU's such that you in effect had little choice but take them all or none.\u00a0 They called those WU's \"roll-ups\" That is when I started thinking, do I really need this and is it worth it.\u00a0 I am not alone, Woody Leonhard is a world famous Windows Update expert and has a very popular blog.\u00a0 He wrote about this.\u00a0 He called the patchacopolipse.\u00a0 You can read his blog at\u00a0https:\/\/www.askwoody.com\/In October, 2016, I started using \"security only\" updates that were available on Microsoft servers to those who knew how to use them.\u00a0 Then in June, 2017, they made a very unfortunate change.\u00a0 The corrected an error in a Security only patch that was only correctable by using their \"roll-up\" updates.\u00a0 That is when I stopped all Microsoft updates.I concluded that the risk of Microsoft turning my smoothly running Windows 7 machine into something that I would not ever consider purchasing was greater than the risk I would be taking by not applying updates.At this point, my 120 client Win7 machines have not had an update in 31 months.\u00a0 That well over 3000 machine months.\u00a0 There has not been a single instance of a problem.\u00a0 Not one.\u00a0 In fact they run beautifully day in day out.\u00a0 I used to average about 6 client calls a day.\u00a0 Today, my phone seldom rings at all.My client machines use Chrome exclusively and a top-end ANTI-Virus product.\u00a0 Note well, that this product is not a so-called security product.\u00a0 It is an Anti-virus only product.\u00a0 I am not allowed in this forum to name a product.I also must point out that none of my clients are enterprises and I would never suggest my strategy for such an environment.\u00a0\u00a0Chrome does not need Java, Adobe Reader, or Adobe Flash Player -- three of the most security problem prone applications on most computers.\u00a0 i have uninstalled them.I have a very detailed process I follow to do this work.\u00a0 You can read my posting on Woody's blog at:https:\/\/www.askwoody.com\/2019\/canadian-tech-how-to-rebuild-a-win7-system-with-minimal-snooping\/","Thanks for all the additional information and, especially, for your support in using Windows 7

explained how to disable the items that allow my Windows 7 laptops to connect to the Internet.\u00a0 So, I've already followed those steps on one of the laptops and will do the same to the other one

They said I have the latest update. They told me I should go buy something better and forget about Cortana. I had too much time invested in it I didn't wanna give up, I was really hoping for something that could help me. I was just trying to hook another Samsung account to it. And it kept popping up and interrupted me and it ended up locking me out of my account. So I've been on the phone with Samsung for an hour to get my account open. I had to shut everything off I could to get it to stop interrupting me I'm popping up while I had them on the phone it kept searching for stuff in Bing when I had Google open using it. I think I have to give up on this thing. Edge doesn't work right my phone isn't right now. This thing does absolutely nothing but cause trouble in less you guys are able to actively help me fix it I'm gonna have to switch back to my old accounts and just go back to what I had before.

Can't get them\u00a0 on the phone, get them on the computer, you are the only person response back .\u00a0 thank you by the way.

But the guides need to be read and tried, all results reported back so I know what you've tried and what to suggest next.If not then if you have a Geek Squad contract I'd use it to get this fixed for you.

I have an Macbook Pro with EGPU set up running on Windows.the GPU is the Amd Radeon vega 56(pretty powerful for most games on 1080p) My other games run fine like GTA5, Battlefront2, Minecraft and Rocket League. However, when I set my display to only be my external display which is running on the EGPU and run r6, I get a BSOD with kernal security check failure, or sometimes DPS watchdog violation. I've done everything on this article. https:\/\/support.ubisoft.com\/en-GB\/faqs\/000025947\/Basic-PC-Troubleshooting\/. Literally everything please do not refer me back here. Anyways sometimes when I followed a specific step on this article the game actually runs and it runs amazing and I get really high frame rates as well just like my other game. But again it's not consistent and it would sometimes just crash again. I then read that r6 sometimes crashes because of multiple monitors, I already had windows set to run only on my external monitor, but I thought why not set it to only run on my internal display and then see what happened. And surprise it actually works and works great and is very consistent. So what I would do is after it runs successfully I would set windows to extended display and then launch again and sometimes it works. Or other times I would first set it to duplicate display, then set it to show only on my external display and it would also work. But that only worked if i set R6 to windows mode. But, I tried the process again to see if I got any consistency and then boom it crashed. By the way, if the game crashes, if i set it to only run on my external display I would actually get the BSOD, but if it is extended or in duplicate on my internal display it would not show BSOD but instead just like this weird glitch effect thing.

Unbelievable that this is still not resolved.","The issue appears to be the login dialog box which gets prompted for credentialing the user to enter a username and password for the VPN CONNECTION.Based on my testing, I figured out that if the username and password is saved in the VPN SETTINGS, then the VPN object from the System Tray works just fine.\u00a0 The problem only happens when the VPN initiates the login and the Login Dialog Box fails to open for prompting the username and password.\u00a0I am not a programmer but it is safe to say the problem seems to stem from the Login Dialog Box not getting the proper permissions and\/or parameters\u00a0 necessary to pop up securely in order to\u00a0 authenticate the user.\u00a0I reported the issue to CISCO MERAKI as well since their online instruction now is partially broken!\u00a0 Based on their documents, if one double clicks the Network VPN Adapter Object that gets created with the setup of the VPN, it will launches the Network Object in the System Tray which is in turn is used to start the VPN CONNECTION and then fails to open the login dialog box.This should be an easy fix if Microsoft actually reads it's own forums for reported issues.Mike Khatibi\u00a0","That doesn't make a bit of sense. I have over 100 VPNs, all with saved credentials, and all start perfectly if connected via the Settings panel without asking for a credential once as the login\/pass are saved during creation. Not a single one connects from the menu.\u00a0","Interesting. I also have 100+ VPN tunnels with SAVED credentials and they all work perfectly fine from the System Tray across multiple laptops\/desktops with version 1903.Are your 1903 use a fresh install of Windows or they were upgraded from previous Versions 1803\/1809?All mines are upgrades and the credentials were initially saved in 1803 or 1809 prior to upgrade.","Both fresh installs from ISO and upgraded exhibit the issue. All the upgraded were from 1809 or 1709. Funny part is that I got one of the 1709 upgrades to work with the VPN from tray...but only some will connect there. Even worse is that every one has the ridiculous ICC profile flashing\/resetting issue on USB activity. Add these two bugs together and 1809 is pretty much annoyingly becoming useless!","Maybe it has to do with the type of VPN created?\u00a0 I only have MERAKI Security Appliances at all my client locations which uses L2TP\/IPSEC with pre shared key and PAP. If you do not mind me asking what do you use?\u00a0","Nope, type doesn't matter. I have L2TP, IKE, PPTP ones and they all do the same. Since everything works from Settings but not the tray, it's more likely that MS screwed up (again) with one of the libraries. They are probably calling an API from the tray that has changed or is missing some component. Typical, though, as they seem to care more about being sure that Xbox **** works, but not a bit about the corporate components."]},{"symptom":"Autostart programs such as Outlook which do not appear in the Taskmanager        Dear Microsoft community,is it possible to Autostart programs such as Outlook and Google Chrome which do not appear in the Taskmanager Autostart tab?Thank you for your help!","solutions":["Hi exceluser_123 .

This is Windows 10 on my Lenovo Yoga 910. Occassionally, my CPU will be working very hard and is generally at 100% usage. I can tell because my fan will be working hard for some time. Once I open Task Manager to see what is causing the problem, I will see a dramatic drop in my CPU usage. Below is a screenshot. This seems very odd to me that opening the Task Manager would decrease CPU usage. For a short bit I noticed that \"System Interrupts\" was at the top of the Processes organized by CPU usage in this instance. This isn't a terrible issue but it would be nice to not have these random CPU spikes.","solutions":["Hi Warpstar22 I'll try to answer your question. When idling, your computer is still doing a lot of things. For example preparing files for a further update, or rearanging files, or scanning for virus, etc.When you open the task manager, Windows stops the work that he was doing on hiw own because you're asking him to do something else.Also, system interrupts is a container that gets a lot of instructions from software \/ hardware. it handles a lot of interactions.I hope this answers your question Regards"]}]}
