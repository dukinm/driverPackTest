I used the Windows 10 Media Creation tool to create an ISO and mount it virtually, then executing the update. I've disabled all external antiviruses, and even use the Malwarebytes Removal tool to scrub Malwarebytes from my system. I've ran sfc \/scannow and DSIM online image repair in safe mode. The update still continues to fail. Any help would be much appreciated.This is the thread I followed to try to read the logs, but I really don't know what to look for:https:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/forum\/all\/windows-10-upgrade-error-0x8007042b-0x4000d\/70dae59f-1cba-4538-95f7-d4a75f98ecc5#windows","solutions":["I'm happy to help. Keep me posted on your progress as I will be here to help until the case is resolved."]},{"symptom":"Windows 10: All network connections stop working periodically        This is a desperate call for help.For years now I have been having the same problem: Once in a while, and for a couple of days at a time, I cannot establish a stable network connection of any type (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) on my desktop PC. The problem disappears by itself after a while and so to this day I do not know the cause of this tormenting issue.I will try to provide useful information and describe the symptoms I encounter as best I can and hope that somebody with the ability to identify my problem will come along and save me from this misery I am finding myself in once again.I have tried all the things that googling for network issues will lead you to, like reinstalling or updating network drivers, renewing the ip config and all that fun stuff, but nothing has worked, and I have searched for a long time.I have also suspected the quality of my internet connection is at fault but that is not the case. While my internet connection is not the best, I don't think it is the reason for my PC being unable to connect to my modem during these periods.My Wi-Fi adapter is connected via PCIe.When my PC is not on its network period, everything works almost all the time and I usually only use my Ethernet connection.I will list some odd behaviors which occur when my PC is on its network period:\u00a0- Ethernet will not be working at all. It will just show \"No internet\" and I will not even be able to ping other devices or anything, the line is just completely dead.\u00a0- This is a rough estimation just to illustrate: 80% of the time my computer will not be connected to the internet or a network, 15% of the time my computer will be connected to the internet with a terrible connection and 5% of the time it will show I am connected to the network, but not the internet.\u00a0- When I try to connect to a Wi-Fi network, there are three different results, although eventually it will always turn out to be the last:a) I get \"Connected, secured\", which will turn out to be a very unstable connection, good enough to stream a video for 10 minutes but not enough to just browse the web or have a voice chat without frequent interruptions.b) I get \"Connected, No internet\", although the same network works fine on other devices.c) I get the error \"Can't connect to this network\", although the same network works fine on other devices.\u00a0- Sometimes, when I click on the network icon in the windows bar on the bottom right, the window will be empty for a couple of seconds with just the loading dots animation at the top, then the window will show with just 2 or 3 nearby Wi-Fi networks nearby when there are usually far more. This is usually a sign that things are completely fricked at that moment.My suspicion is that there is something fundamentally wrong with my PC, possibly on a hardware level. But I don't know how to pinpoint my issue or how to describe it properly and have thus not been able to find any solutions on my own.This may be completely irrelevant, but I will mention it: When the most recent \"network period\" started, i had some humming in my audio interface, this does not happen usually, and hasn't happened for a long time.Please let me know if there is any other information I should provide.Thank you for taking the time.Any input is greatly appreciated.","solutions":["Hi, champiebampie My name is Jeffrey and I am an Independent Advisor.

I already checked all information on the Internet and did all troubleshooting and uninstall \/ install operations - nothing helped. But let me describe the issue:1. With the Logitech Mouse M705:\u00a0It suddenly stopped working and I noticed the \"Device\u00a0 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match\" in the USB Composite Device properties. I changed to another Logitech Mouse with another remote adapter and this worked for a while until it got the same issue. And so I changed to yet another mouse with a cable connection and this works as of now.2, With an ASUS external display connected via HDMIThis happened last night while using the display. The display stopped working after using it for a couple of hours in the middle of a Karaoke party. I checked the event viewer and noticed that there was some automatic WIndows Update going on at the time it stopped working. I still can connect the device and Windows recognizes the device but nothing is displayed. And of course the \"Generic PnP Monitor\" device has this crazy \"was not migrated\" issue. When I open the \"Advanced Display Settings\" I can see both displays listed. As you might guess the mouse workaround by buying new mice would be too costly for displays.Note that all my drivers are up to date including the Intel drivers and the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050, which is listed for the malfunctioning display.The system is a Windows 10 Home Edition Version 1803.Here the event for the display:Device DISPLAY\\ACI24FA\\5&aaea2d5&1&UID4352 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.Last Device Instance Id: DISPLAY\\LGD0590\\4&223d200f&0&UID0Class Guid: {4D36E96E-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}Location Path:\u00a0Migration Rank: 0xF000FFFF0000F100Present: falseStatus: 0xC0000719","solutions":["Hello DanielScholzCH,Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums. I understand how difficult it feels when the devices stop functioning as they are supposed to. Let\u2019s try to narrow down the issue by following the below methods:Method 1: Check for Updates.Driver updates in Windows 10 are automatically installed along with Windows Updates. But you can go ahead and check if there is any new update available for that particular driver. You can go through the article onhow to update drivers in Windows 10.Method 2: Roll back driver.If there are no new updates available for the driver, it shows that you have already installed the latest build of drivers. At that situation, you may roll back driver and check if the works. Sometimes rolling back to the previous build resolves the issue. \u00a0Also, you may uninstall the device and driver package from device manager. To do that, you may go through the article onhow devices and driver packages are uninstalled.Method 3: BIOS Update. The error which you are getting could also be due to problematic BIOS (Basic Input and Output System). Hence, you could update your BIOS to fix the issue.BIOS Disclaimer: Modifying BIOS\/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problemsresulting from the configuring of BIOS\/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.\u00a0Hope it helps.

The culprit is the Windows Update and the only possible way to get back to a clean system would apparently be to reinstall Windows 10 and then make sure that no Windows Update will ever run uncontrolled.Who provides the drivers for the \"USB Composite Device\" and the \"Generic PnP Montitor\"? Microsoft? Ahhhh :-) ... and do I have a \"rollback\" option there? Oooops ... no Sir .... no chance ...And please try to understand the really silly message.\u00a0\"Devce xyz\u00a0was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.\" Wow ... So there was a partial or ambiguous mismatch discovered by the Windows Update running in the background and the decision was to declare the device to stop functioning. And ironically these device drivers are from the very same company that proudly runs the Windows Update.Now let me prove to you that I am right and that *WIndows Update\" is confused and not any BIOS or other components.1. The issue arises on a running system when a Windows Update is busy in the background. E.g. the external display was running fine for 5 hours until it suddenly stopped working. The only changing process running at the very time was \"Windows Update\". The same is true for the mice that I have lost.2. The drivers for the devices still work \"partially\". E,g, the external display is still recognized correctly and the Logitech Utility still discovers the mouse. The pointers just don't move.\u00a0 The monitor remains black. The devices are still working. The connections are still working.3. The Device Manager does not flag the devices as faulty. You have to go into the events tab to see that there is something wrong. This is a Device Manager error by itself as it does not report the problem.4. I have 2 \"Generic PnP Montitor\" entries - one for the Laptop display and one for the external ASUS display. Both are the same Microsoft drivers. But only the ASUS shows this partial ambiguity error. The same is true for the USB Composite Device. I have 2 USB ports and only when I attach the Logitech mouse then I get this issue.\u00a05. 2 and 4 prove that it can't be the provider drivers. They are still working but they are prevented to work correctly by these generic Microsoft drivers or better the device management which is confused by ambiguity. (btw. I uninstalled \/ installed those drivers just in case).6. Can it be a BIOS problem? Could you believe that the BIOS would suddenly decide after 5 hours that it does not like the Asus monitor anymore? Or the Logitech mouse? Or the many other devices reported here by the community? That's not a BIOS problem.I have 33 years experience in the IT industry and when I learned something about this type of problems then it is to acknowledge the facts and believe that the process running when an issue occurs is also the culprit. Just believe it.There would be a nice quick fix for Windows - just ignore your ambiguous \/ partial decision and let the drivers do their work. Flag it in the device manager with a warning and so let the user decide if there is really an ambiguous situation that needs to be worked on.And so Mala - please go back to development and open a problem record.

I currently have Windows 7 Home Premium Service Pack 1, on a Toshiba Satellite C855 laptop. I want to upgrade to Windows 10, but Idon't want to lose any of my 20+ non-factory, non-OS apps. Having to individually reinstall and reconfigure dozens of apps would take a lot of time and money I just don't have. I heard that the upgrade will leave applications intact, but there's some confusion about what happens if a non-Win10-compatibile app is found during the upgrade. Does it:automatically uninstall it (very, very bad!),abort with a list of apps to uninstall before trying again, then reinstall\/upgrade afterward (better), orupgrade the OS anyway, leaving it up to you to upgrade problem apps (ideal, albeit at one's own risk)?Also, I need to know if the following apps are Win10-compatible:Visual Studio 2015,Microsoft Word 2010,Skype 8.20, andother Microsoft products dated back to 2008\u00a0Please respond ASAP.","solutions":["I can't answer those questions but the first thing to do is see if there are Windows 10 drivers for your system.So hop out to the Toshiba Satellite C855 Support\/driver page and take a look at what drivers they offer.Of course you would have to enter your own exact model\/serial number:With no Windows 10 drivers offered the upgrade from 7 to 10 might not go very well for you.Before you start it would behoove you to make an image of your current system so when or if something goes horribly wrong during the upgrade you will be able to restore the image and start over again.Maybe you will have better luck by entering your system information or ask in their community forums:https:\/\/support.dynabook.com\/forums"]},{"symptom":"newest win10 update messed up my parents computer, now they have no access to important finical sites or records, and can't even navigate their computer        What the heck!

Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

(with all hardware unchanged when that image was saved)\u00a0 ...Problem still persistsAny other ideas?","Try resetting the network: https:\/\/www.thewindowsclub.com\/windows-10-netwo...","I did that too.\u00a0\u00a0 No change.by the way...I did notice that turning OFF IPv6 (Ethernet) causes all GOOGLE sites to also fail, just like all the other urls.\u00a0When I turn on IPv6, Google sites work again.\u00a0 So, is Google's advantage here that they adapt to IPv6, and most other url server\/sites do not?","Are you connected to Google DNS? https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/164981\/how-to-switch-...","No...\u00a0 The IPV4 settings were set for DNS server connect automatically.Just now changed them to the Google DNS, experienced same issues.then changed it back to\u00a0 obtain DNS server connecting automatically","Does the same thing happen now with ethernet cable? That narrows the problem to Wifi.Try another wifi adapter to compare. That would narrow it to Windows. Otherwise let's try some driver swapping. Under WIfi adapter in Device Manager, try uninstalling the Wifi adapter, then reinstall by restarting PC.Next try all previous WIfi adapters via Update Driver > Browse > Let Me Pick. Next try auto Update of driver. Then try all old and newer Wifi drivers on the Dell Support Downloads web page for your Service tag. Even try the Windows 8.1, 8 and 7 drivers if available. This will eliminate driver as cause.Is there a BIOS Update? Chipset?","Thank you for all the suggestions...This really is a great forum.Sometimes, it's just helpful to have \"the village\" weigh in with possiblities in the reasoning process...PROBLEM SOLVED...After reasoning that IPV6 worked with Google based apps, but failed when IPV6 was disabled (even though IPV4 was enabled)...I reasoned that either a new Windows 10 update had created an unsolvable conflict or possibly a marginal hardware failure had occurred somewhere in the motherboard based Realtek PCI GBE Family Ethernet Controller to cause IPV4 to fail(especially, after applying each one of the suggested remedies from Microsoft, AT&T ConnectTech, and this forum)So I just plugged in a $13 PCIe Gigabit adapter from HiRO and...All is functioning properly again without having to make any other setting changes to Windows 10,except I did disable the original Realtek PCI GBE Family Ethernet Controller in \"Device Manager\"(whether I needed to or not).It was a totally \"plug and play\" experience.So... Since this specific problem was solved in this case by merely replacing the Ethernet adapter,it might be a good idea for folks to add this cheap fix as a possible remedy to the \"try this list\",somewhere before giving up and suggesting a complete Windows re-installation.like an AT&T ConnectTech CSR had guided me to do, which turned out to be completely unnecessary in this case.","Forrest - I'm glad to hear that the suggestion to replace with an inexpensive network adapter to compare, worked for you. This is becoming an increasingly viable step as older adapter are deprecated or start having issues in the newer versions. Right now I'm testing several replacement nano adapters for my two year old Dell laptop which never had 5ghz and is starting to fail.Let me know if there's anything else.
