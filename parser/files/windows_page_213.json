Headphone and mic out are the only audio-related outputs.\u00a0","How are you planning on hearing\/routing the audio? The gaming monitors you are using have no built-in speakers, like a TV would. No Microsoft OS software update can fix that. Connecting the rear headphone jack to 3.5mm (analog) speakers or sound bar would be the method of obtaining audio out on those models. Headphone and mic out are the only audio-related outputs.\u00a0Dear TechfreakThat is indeed a very good question. First of all, HDMI and DP do both contain Auxiliary Channels. However, if you plug in headphones you either get horrible noise together with no windows sound on audio output or it gives no sound at all on mic. Nice try though. I didn't tell you guys the display had no speakers. ;D"]},{"symptom":"REplacing motherboard with refurbished motherboard        Hello and thank you in advance.\u00a0 I have a laptop that works fine, other than it cuts off randomly for no reason.\u00a0 A repair tech said it was a glitch in the motherboard.\u00a0 That being said I want to replace the motherboard but I'm concerned about getting my Windows 10 to be recognized by the new motherboard.\u00a0 Can anyone kindly tell me how I would get Windows 10 on the new motherboard without having to purchase another version which I think would be totally unfair.\u00a0 Thanks again in advance for any help","solutions":["Hi Keith, to keep license you need to replace motherboard by warranty.

Prior to AU (1607) my m\/c was at 1511 (Windows build 10.0.10586)2. AU arrived on my box overnight on 11 Oct and the following day I saw- on my initial WIN 10 screen - \u00a0\"Getting Started\" followed 30 secs later with \"Cannot start Camera. Please sign in with PIN\"3. Drivers and BIOS Checked and updated where appropriate BUT . . . . 4. Realtek IR driver under \"Device Manager\" - \"Imaging Devices\" - \"Properties\" - \"Driver\"\u00a0is at10.0.10586.11211, For a 1607 AU OS it should be most likely 10.0.14393.xxxxx - to reflect the 1607 product number!!So, until Realtek update their driver to the 1607 level, we shall just have to live with the camera being defunct - or roll back to 1511.
