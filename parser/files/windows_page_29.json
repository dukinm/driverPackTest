I would like to assist you with this and hopefully I can help you to resolve this issue promptly.Unfortunately windows explorer does not have font size settings built in that allow you to adjust the size of fonts inside it. You can use system scaling in display properties which you already know changes more than just explorer.It may be possible to change this via a registry setting however that would not be advisable.You could also look into some 3rd party software such as \"Alternate Font\" that allows you to customize certain areas of windows with different fonts etc. I am unsure if it will do exactly what you require though.https:\/\/www.ghacks.net\/2018\/06\/23\/customize-fon...I know this isn't the answer you was looking for unfortunately. Best of luck finding a solution. I personally find the windows scaling feature great and easy to turn on and off when required. I run my Surface Book at 125% mostly but sometimes up it to 150% when using some software. I know you mentioned you have tried this but for others that may read this you just...Right click on desktop and select \"Display Settings\" then change the Scale setting as required. And doing this is much more advisable over 3rd party software or modifying registry or system files.Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.

The Media you choose to install from will depend on certain factors, such as the Boot Scheme used by your computer (BIOS, UEFI) in addition to the storage device (hard disk partitioning layout). Examples of partitioning layout include MBR (BIOS) and GPT (UEFI). In this article, we show you several ways to create a bootable copy of Windows 10 from an ISO file. An ISO file is a digital replica of a virtual disc, which users will have to make bootable on a blank DVD, USB thumb drive or SD card.DetailsBefore we begin, you need to have a copy of Windows 10 ISO file. See the following article for instructions how to download a ISO image for Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool:How to download official Windows 10 ISO files\u00a0NOTE: Microsoft no longer provides direct access to Windows 10 ISO images from the Microsoft Techbench website for computers running Windows 7, Windows 8.0, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10.

The thumb drive needs to be formatted as FAT32. If you are installing on a hard disks that is 4 TBs or more in size, you need to format the disk using the GPT partitioning scheme. Rufus ensures your copy of Windows 10 is properly prepared to support it. You can download Rufus, for free.After downloading Rufus, connect your thumb drive, launch Rufus application, click in the Device list box then choose your thumb drive.Click in the list box then choose your partition scheme. If you select the ISO, Rufus will automatically select the appropriate options for you. Next, click in the File system list box, then choose FAT32. If your thumb drive is larger than 32 GBs, choose exFAT. Leave the default Cluster size then enter a label for your thumb drive. Click the choose disk image icon, browse to where the ISO file is located, select it then click Open.Click Start to copy the files to the thumb drive. If you have any files on the thumb drive, they will be deleted. Wait while the files are copied to your thumb drive.
