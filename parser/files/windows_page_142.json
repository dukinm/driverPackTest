Drive C is a Samsung SSD and was partitioned as Healthy (Boot, Crash Dump, Page File, Primary Partition). Drive D is an older WD HDD, and was partitioned as Healthy (System, Active, Primary), I assume because it was the original drive that Windows 7 was installed on.Unfortunately, I think I followed some bad advice and removed the HDD (D drive) and rebooted my machine with a Windows Recovery USB in an attempt to repair the boot and get everything on my SSD (C drive) so I could scrap the HDD.

Otherwise the computer will load from the hard drive as normal.Start by plugging the thumb drive into a USB port. Then to change the BIOS boot sequence: Press the Power button for your computer. During the initial startup screen, press ESC, F1, F2, F8 or F10. (Depending on the company that created your version of BIOS, a menu may appear.) When you choose to enter BIOS Setup, the setup utility page will appear. Using the arrow keys on your keyboard, select the BOOT tab. All of the available system devices will be displayed in order of their boot priority.You can reorder the devices here. Move USB to be first in the boot sequence. NOTE: If you cannot find USB or Removable Devices among the device options, your BIOS may list it under Hard Drive Devices. In that case, you\u2019ll need to: Move Hard Drive Devices to the top Expand to show all hard drive device options Move USB device to the top of that hard drive list Save the change and then exit the BIOS Setup. The computer will restart using the new settings, booting from your USB drive. Stay alert! Depending on your BIOS, you may be prompted with a message to Press any key to boot from external device and you will only have a few seconds to respond.If you do nothing, your computer will go to the next device in the boot sequence list, which will likely be your hard drive.In the future, your computer will first check the USB port for boot media when starting up.That won\u2019t be a problem, since the BIOS will move to the next device in the boot sequence ... unless you keep the boot media in the USB port.Then the system will launch from that device every time.
