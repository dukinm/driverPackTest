Windows will then prompt you to add a new user by email address (which requires a Microsoft account), however by choosing \"I don't have this person's sign-in information\" and then \"Add a user without a Microsoft account\" you can add a local account without doing that if you prefer.Regards, David"]},{"symptom":"Orchestrator Console after IE 11 goes away        I have recently spun up a new System Center Orchestrator 2019 server and noticed an upcoming issue.The Orchestrator Console still uses Silverlight, which is only supported in IE 11.IE 11 is going EoL in the next couple of weeks, which means it will be disabled in our machines here.Does anyone know of a way to keep using the console?\u00a0 Is Microsoft going to update the console to HTML 5, or just let it die?Thanks.","solutions":["Your question is outside the scope of this Community..Kindly repost in the TechNet Forums:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/en-US\/homeCheers."]},{"symptom":"Can I download and use Edge browser?

Activation depends on what type of license you have.
