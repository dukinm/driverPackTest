{"windows":[{"symptom":"Windows 10 Update 1909 doesn't work on my computer        I have been trying to update my computer first of all from 1803 to 1809 and now 1909 since May 2019 and it won't work for either. Microsoft have tried every possible method and they say only a clean install can now be tried.\u00a0 Why should I have to go to all this bother trying to back up all my data and printing out all my e-mails as they will be lost? I don't want the features these updates offer anyway but I can't seem to turn them off. Microsoft rung me over 30 times so it has been a waste of manpower resources too.One of the problems is that my computer won't restart and so every time it tries during the updates I have to power off and on again. This I have to do twice and it continues with the installation but then stops at 87% every time. This time when I power off it goes back to the previous version. The error code is always the same -it is during the 'Migrate data' phase.If anyone can offer any suggestions I would be grateful. Also, if restart doesn't work, will a clean install work?","solutions":["Hi, Apologies if you have tried this already. But have you tried using the \"Upgrade now\" option from the Windows 10 download site? Windows will use a disk image that's stored in your system files for feature updates manually. If this is corrupt it can cause issues updating, this is why we typically recommend repairing with windows boot media when there are other Windows issues. Upgrade now will use a clean image from the latest version to perform the upgrade without needing to repair with a boot disk first.As for whether a clean install would work, in theory it should. As any thing it's having trouble migrating from an old version wouldn't be moved with a clean install. But we can't guarantee that will be the case.I hope that helps."]},{"symptom":"Kernel Mode Heap Corruption in WIndows 10 Pro        The last few days my computer has crashed at random points and given me the same blue screen error labeled: Kernel_Mode_Heap_Corruption.

Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button. Restart PC to reinstall.8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too. For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list. To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick. Finally, try installing the latest Sound driver in Compatibility Mode as shown here:https:\/\/social.technet.microsoft.com\/Forums\/win...9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings>Update & Security>Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 10) If this was caused by a Version update (which you can confirm at Settings > System > About) then you can roll back the version in Settings>Update & Security>Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:http:\/\/download.microsoft.com\/download\/f\/2\/2\/f2... 11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:http:\/\/home.bt.com\/tech-gadgets\/computing\/how-t... 12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m...

It's a UK program created by a now defunct (since 2007) company, Pixology, called Jessops Picture Manager Version 1.0.0.13 part of Jessops Picture suite copyright date 2003. Jessops processed pictures taken on film and with the prints provided them also on CD for which this software was required to view them.This has been fine to view these old photos but this software has now hijacked the viewing of all and any photos on my Windows 10 desktop computer with its Picture Manager.\u00a0Having now printed all the Photos and re-scanned them as modern scanned images, I no longer need this software so need to uninstall it.When I try to uninstall it I get the following message: 'Could not open INSTALL.LOG file'. I have tried to uninstall with the Jessops CD in the drive but this does not find this file. I have not been able to uninstall this program nor have I found a way to disable it.\u00a0How can I now uninstall this program?","solutions":["Hi Stephen Click the link below to download the Free version of Revo Uninstaller, it can uninstall even the most stubborn of applications:https:\/\/www.revouninstaller.com\/products\/revo-u...Also, open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu) Go to Apps - Default Apps At the top of that page, set the Default Picture Viewer to the Photos App . . . ________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: This is a non-Microsoft website.

I'll look next at uninstalling the program following your suggestion.I had already ensured that 'pictures' always opened with the Photo App which was already set as the default but this didn't seem to stop this other program 'hijacking' my Pictures; not now an immediate issue but thanks for the suggestion.Stephen."]}]}
