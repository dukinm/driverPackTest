Thank you very much!I believe I had no third party security software installed and I suspect Oracle Virtualbox's networking driver could be the cause but I'm not sure.So far I was able to pull multiple strings referencing to a driver - power state issue,but it is called HDAudBus (sound card?) and I'm confused. I never had issues with my sound card, which is the internal one for this notebook.

The processor is AMD A4, which is a processor I have never used before, as I always used Intel. It\u2019s only new, so I don\u2019t know why I have already got these problems.

Does anyone have any advice for me?\u00a0Thanks, MicrosoftUser3487","solutions":["Hi MU. I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 10 year Windows MVP, and Volunteer Guardian Moderator here to help you.1) At any time you can do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy: http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... The reason I suggest this first is because no one who has done the above install has ever come back to report problems that I have seen.2) Until then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:http:\/\/answers.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/wiki... Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 3) Update your drivers and BIOS\/UEFI firmware from PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker. Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu. Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from their Support Downloads web page.4) For high CPU and hard drive usage see here: http:\/\/www.thewindowsclub.com\/fix-100-disk-usag...https:\/\/www.cleverfiles.com\/howto\/100-disk-usag...https:\/\/www.kapilarya.com\/fix-windows-10-high-c...https:\/\/www.makeuseof.com\/tag\/fix-high-cpu-usag...5) If nothing else works then do a Repair Install, by installing Media Creation Tool, open tool and choose to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows while keeping files, programs and most settings in place, and is also the most stable method to advance to the latest version. http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows-10\/m... I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you will wait to choose if I solved your problem, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.________________________________________________________ Standard Disclaimer: There are links to non-Microsoft websites.
