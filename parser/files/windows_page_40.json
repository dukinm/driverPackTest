Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 4) If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.

Can you uninstall the device and software that installed the emBDA64.sys which may be a USB audio device.","Hmmm...that sounds interesting.\u00a0 I'm actually not entirely sure what device\/software emBDA64.sys is referenced to.\u00a0 Is there any information in the memdump that might indicate that?\u00a0 I'm guessing at this point that the Hauppauge video capture USB device might be what is having a problem.\u00a0 I really just can't think of anything else.\u00a0 I don't actually use the Hauppauge device, but it is installed and it was installed before the update.\u00a0 So, maybe the old software doesn't play nice with a newer version of windows.\u00a0 I never really got it working and abandoned it a while back, so it's not a problem to remove it.Other USB devices include dongles for wireless keyboard\/mouse, PS3 controller (for charging not for playing), and the Hauppauge video capture.\u00a0 When I get home tonight, I'm uninstalling the Hauppauge device and seeing how that goes.\u00a0 If there are any other suggestions, thanks in advance.","It could very well be the Hauppauge device. In the Device Manager if you double-click the Hauppauge device > Driver Details Does it list the emBDA64.sys as a driver? Also, if you re-enable the NVIDIA audio after removing the Hauppage device and driver does it still crash?","I removed the Hauppauge software\/drivers first thing this evening and didn't see the suggestion to see if it was using the\u00a0emBDA64.sys driver beforehand.\u00a0 I won't probably know whether this was the culprit until sometime tomorrow morning.\u00a0 It usually requires some time with the display off and turning it back on for the crash to occur.\u00a0 Fingers are crossed that it doesn't crash.\u00a0 I think the Hauppauge software was old, so I believe there is a decent chance it was the problem.\u00a0 I'll report back tomorrow."]},{"symptom":"cant launch certain apps, keep getting kernelbase.dll error        as of 4 days ago i can no longer open osu, discord, or tabletdrivergui. when i click on them, they show up in task manager for half a second, then two errors appear in eventviewer:Application: osu!.exeFramework Version: v4.0.30319Description: The process was terminated due to an unhandled exception.Exception Info: System.OutOfMemoryException\u00a0 \u00a0at #=zfJ9zAT7nDD42z$NcsA==.#=zxVmq$$w=(System.String[])\u00a0 \u00a0at #=zfJ9zAT7nDD42z$NcsA==.#=zlDSXfpM=()\u00a0 \u00a0at #=qXQMuiY2x1vw02Zd9pmV2TmxE_$5QQr_2TdaFlCpGUA0=.#=zDSGh9ZY=()Faulting application name: osu!.exe, version: 1.3.3.7, time stamp: 0x5e0f8cfcFaulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version: 10.0.14393.2189, time stamp: 0x5abda7d6Exception code: 0xe0434352Fault offset: 0x000daa12Faulting process id: 0x42a0Faulting application start time: 0x01d5c8b9d30c7643Faulting application path: C:\\Users\\omphen\\AppData\\Local\\osu!\\osu!.exeFaulting module path: C:\\WINDOWS\\System32\\KERNELBASE.dllReport Id: c43d13e1-8d3b-4fd5-a4b4-4e3a7968758bFaulting package full name:\u00a0Faulting package-relative application ID:\u00a0ive tried running \/sfc scannow which has found nothing wrong, i cant uninstall .net framework nor can i install the latest version as it is already installed.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Red Screen at Startup        Most days at startup (from sleep mode) I get a series of colored screens.

Upon restarting, it automatically launched the windows automatic repair tool. It was making slow progress for a while, but upon some googling, I decided to let it run overnight. When I woke up this morning, the repair tool must have finished, because it was stuck at the motherboard boot screen that pops up before Windows loads. No inputs did anything, I couldn't reach the BIOS or drive selection so I restarted the system and this time it gave me a black screen after the motherboard boot screen and stayed there. At this point I tried nearly every troubleshooting guide under the sun and nothing will work. I have messed with\u00a0 the boot options in the BIOS, reset the BIOS to default, I can't boot windows in safe mode, I have tried reinstalling from the installation disk, I have tried all the troubleshooting options that \"repair your computer\" gives you off the installation disk, it just tells me that it can't perform the System Restore, Startup Repair, I can't uninstall either feature or quality updates, it can't find any system recovery image files. Now when I try to boot the system it tells me \"A disk read error has occurred, press ctrl+alt+de to restart\" but restarting just puts me back in the same place. I have been following troubleshooting guides and messing with every option available to me, but I have only been making backwards progress and now absolutely nothing is working to the point that most troubleshooting isn't even an option because there's so little my system will do.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Your Version of Flash Player might be outdated        Why am I getting the pop up, \"Your Version of Flash Player might be outdated....When I get it the address bar has info that its' from a site called 'unifiedinstaller.com .
