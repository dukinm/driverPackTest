I am hopeful that someone is familiar enough with the boot process to provide enough insight, or leverage a Microsoft\/Dell\/Samsung response, to correct the behavior.\u00a0BACKGROUND\u00a0I purchased a Dell Inspiron 3050, which came with a Samsung 32GB SSD and Windows 8.1.\u00a0Windows 8.1 upgraded to Windows 10 on the 32GB SSD with no problems.\u00a0I installed a leftover 500GB mechanical SATA drive with no problems.\u00a0I purchased a Samsung 250GB SSD as a system drive to replace the original 32GB SSD. To accomplish this, I first migrated Windows 10 to the 500GB mechanical drive with no problems. I removed the 32GB SSD and installed the 250GB SSD with no problems. I used the same process to move Windows 10 back to the SSD as was used to move it to the mechanical drive. The transfer process succeeded without error, but the drive would not boot.\u00a0Through all iterations of BIOS, driver, and Windows 10 updates, the new SSD was recognizable and useable but would not boot Windows 10.\u00a0CURRENTLY (new SSD)\u00a0Windows 10 (1909) is installed with all service updates on the mechanical drive. I have confirmed that the BIOS, Dell driver updates, and SSD firmware are current.\u00a0With Windows 10 (1903), the system would not reboot during the upgrade unless the SSD was removed. (I subsequently rolled back to Windows 10 (1809).) With Windows 10 (1909), I have determined that it will boot with the SSD installed, but only if the SSD is uninitialized or initialized with nothing allocated to any volume\/partition. So, the SSD is still recognized but no longer useable.\u00a0CHARACTERISTICS (new SSD)\u00a0I can create a primary partition on the SSD, assign a drive letter to it, and it works perfectly - until I reboot. During the boot I can enter the BIOS setup and boot menu, but it will not transfer to Windows, either by the Windows Boot Manager nor by a BIOS boot file entry. (Both methods work if the SSD is unallocated.)\u00a0No Windows event log entries are created during the failed boot. No errors or messages are displayed. The PC apparently completely stops - no drive activity, turns off immediately with the power button, cannot coerce a memory dump, and immediately restarts with Alt-Ctrl-Del.\u00a0When the SSD is allocated I can boot to a Windows 10 (1809) recovery drive. I cannot boot to a Windows 10 (1909) recovery drive. Both recovery drives boot correctly when the SSD is not allocated, suggesting that something in Windows 10 has changed.\u00a0Startup repair finds nothing to fix. The only connected devices are: Wired USB keyboard, wired USB mouse, monitor.\u00a0I have never encountered an error using the SSD other than the current failure to boot if allocated, or its previous failure to boot as the boot device with Windows 10 installed.\u00a0Windows 10 (1909) boots and operates perfectly with the original 32GB SSD installed. The original 32GB SSD also continues to boot (Windows 10) and operate perfectly when selected as the boot device.\u00a0The mechanical drive identifies as 'Drive 0'. The SSD identifies as 'Drive 1'.","solutions":[]},{"symptom":"Audio Device Dropped no cause can be found        Hardware:\u00a0 Windows 10 laptop Dell Latitude E7470 (all drivers updated by company ITLaptop connected to Room Display unit via HDMI cable (no issues)Audio device selected via USB connection is Room Crestron Speakers and MicrophoneTeams voip only meeting (no dial in users or connection)2 1\/2 hours into the meeting the audio was lost.\u00a0The Technology Operations Officer was in charge of the presentation laptop and checked the audio device list:\u00a0 the room speakers and mic no longer displayed as an option.\u00a0 The meeting was finished using a dial in audio bridge.\u00a0 The computer never regained the room speakers and microphone as a connection option.What would cause this issue?","solutions":["Hi MM, You may want to use the troubleshooter first. https:\/\/support.microsoft.com\/en-gb\/help\/452028...If problems still persist, please check this article instead: https:\/\/www.howtogeek.com\/395296\/fix-my-microph...Note: This is a non-Microsoft website.
