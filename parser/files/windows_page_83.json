This happens for our users but not on my administrative account. And when I give the user administrative rights, they no longer have the issue. I'm going to review the ADMX files for 1903 and see if I can find some kind of group policy setting that needs to be adjusted.","I can tell you this has something to do with administrative settings.

I'm going to review the ADMX files for 1903 and see if I can find some kind of group policy setting that needs to be adjusted.I am also seeing the same behavior on my end. Admin accounts work, but standard users don't. So obviously some permissions broke during the upgrade. I've tried checking the folder permissions for\u00a0C:\\Windows\\System32\\spool\\drivers\\x64 but that is not working either.\u00a0","Interesting - I'm fine with the belief that it's a permission issue, but not sure why that folder would affect the display settings.\u00a0Just a reminder - all functionality is there if you use tab to get to the buttons and then ENTER to activate the button, the issue is completely around display.","Well, what's interesting is the standard user does not have the \"Remove device\" button.Standard User View: Open Queue, ManageAdmin View: Open Queue, Manage, Remove DeviceI'm making an assumption that whatever ties to\/around that permission may correct the display problem?","Have non admin users had remove device in the past?\u00a0 I use GPO to grant my users the rights to install\/remove printers as non admins.. so I'm not sure what normal people see in a non GPO setup."]},{"symptom":"Address in Long Branch        642 McClellan Street","solutions":["Hello MikeLeVien, You have posted in Microsoft community.. do you have any question or discussion regarding Microsoft products or services?Cheers!
