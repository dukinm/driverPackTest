The ones that have had problems so far are these:Conan Exiles, Crash Bandicoot N'Sane Trilogy, Spyro Reignited Trilogy and League Of Legends. I am also having problems with the Blizzard Battle.Net application.All games are original, purchased and installed by Valve's Steam app, but even though I do everything possible, I can no longer play them. I've tried several alternatives like reinstalling games, checking file integrity, updating Direct X, upgrading Visual Basic c ++, running with compatibility, upgrading all pc drives, including Nvidia card, back windows and card upgrade Nvidia for the previous version and other things, but the same errors still persist.Before when I installed the pirated version of the same games, downloaded by Torrent, they were running perfectly without any problems, errors, crashes, bugs, lags or delays, I even managed to make some lives for Mixer, but when I tried to reinstall them again to compare the ones. files, they started to give the same problem as the originals. That is, I believe the issue is not the game itself, but something on the computer.I no longer know what to do to fix or what to appeal to. It is only these games that have problems. Others I have installed on the pc are Monster Hunter World, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition, The Elder Scrolls Online, Okami HD among others and none of them have any errors or problems to run.These are the specifications of the notebook gamer I use:- Brand: Acer- Model: AN515-51-50U2Operational system:- Windows 10 Home 64-bitCPU and Chipset:- Intel\u00ae Core \u2122 i5-7300HQ- 7th generation - Quad Core- 2.5 GHz - 3.5 GHz with Turbo Boost- 6 MB SmartCache- Intel\u00ae HM175 ChipsetRAM memory:- 8 GB DDR typeVideo card:- NVIDIA\u00ae GeForce\u00ae GTX 1050 with 4 GB of dedicated GDDR5 memoryStorage:- 2.5 \u201dhard drive with 1TB capacity- SATA III (6 GB \/ s) - 5,400 RPMThe Blizzard Battle.Net app doesn't maximize on the screen, although I can run the games I have (World Of Warcraft and Overwatch) by the shortcuts on the pc home screen, but I can no longer access the store or even install new games since the window is not shown.In the case of League Of Legends, the game does not open on the screen, although the taskbar icon appears and the login screen music starts playing.

Set 1st monitor as main display and moved windows back.Set display settings to \"Extend\" multiple times\u00a0Changed power cable - but since I know the monitor already works, I didn't figure that would matter - it didn't.On screen display doesn't offer Factory Reset on the 2nd monitor (but I can see that) so I can't try that option, but I don't think I've ever messed with any of those settings, so should be \"like-new\" settings.\u00a0Nothing has worked. I've been at this for about 6-1\/2 hours - I figure there is some setting somewhere that I'm missing but for the life of me, I can't find it.
